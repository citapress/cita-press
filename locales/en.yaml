about:
  top_paragraph_body: cita is a library and press devoted to highlighting, publishing and promoting works written by women. We pair contemporary authors and designers with open-access texts, and make carefully designed books available for free!
  left_column_body: >-
    <p>In Spanish, “<span class="blue">cita</span>” is the word for appointment, quotation, and date. It is also the diminutive suffix for feminine nouns, <i>mujer</i> is woman; <i>mujer<span class="blue">cita</span></i> is little woman.</b></p>

    <p><span class="mini-title">Manifesto:</span>
      <li>To elevate the work of those who first addressed gender inequality </li>
      <li>To use open-source resources and actively credit them </li>
      <li>To maintain the content in open-access platforms, licenses and formats</li>
      <li>To give free access to the content</li>
      <li>To make visible and celebrate the work of contributors</li>
      <li>To pair classic literature with contemporary open scholarship and design</li>
      <li>To be committed to intersectionality</li>
      <li>To be participatory, crowdsourced and open to new voices and collaborations</li>

    <p><span class="mini-title">What:</span> Carefully designed public-domain books written by women in free, contemporary editions for print and web. </p>
    <p><span class="mini-title">How:</span> <span class="blue">cita</span> is a collaborative labor of love between designers and writers that relies on public-domain writings and open-source texts, fonts, code, and images. All the content of <span class="blue">cita</span> is either public-domain, or is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons License CC-NC-SA 4.0</a>, meaning it’s free forever, and sharable for non-commercial purposes so long as you can share if you say who created it.

For more details, check the <a href="pages/collaborate.html" data-title="Collaborate">collaborate page</a>.</p>
    <p><span class="mini-title">Why:</span> Women authors have historically been underrepresented and underpublicized in the male-dominated, profit-driven publishing industry. We make these women writers’ works accessible to all, in free editions.</p>
    <p><span class="mini-title">Who:</span> <span class="blue">cita</span> was created by <a href="http://julianacastro.co">Juliana Castro</a>, a Colombian graphic designer and editor, in collaboration with a growing list of <a href="pages/collaborate.html" data-title="Collaborate">contributors</a>. <a href="pages/collaborate.html" data-title="Collaborate">Join us!</a></p>

  paragraph_body: Our books range in genre from fiction to memoir to essay and poetry. Most texts include a foreword by a contemporary writer or scholar, which helps readers understand the context in which the author was writing, and what the work means for today.
