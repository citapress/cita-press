about:
  top_paragraph_body: cita is a library and press devoted to highlighting, publishing and promoting works written by women. We pair contemporary authors and designers with open-access texts, and make carefully designed books available for free!
  left_column_body: >-
    <p>In Spanish, “<span class="blue">cita</span>” is the word for appointment, quotation, and date. It is also the diminutive suffix for feminine nouns, <i>mujer</i> is woman; <i>mujer<span class="blue">cita</span></i> is little woman.</b></p>

    <p><span class="mini-title">Manifesto:</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>To elevate the work of those who first addressed gender inequality </li>
      <li>To use open-source resources and actively credit them </li>
      <li>To maintain the content in open-access platforms, licenses and formats</li>
      <li>To give free access to the content</li>
      <li>To make visible and celebrate the work of contributors</li>
      <li>To pair classic literature with contemporary open scholarship and design</li>
      <li>To be committed to intersectionality</li>
      <li>To be participatory, crowdsourced and open to new voices and collaborations</li>

    <p><span class="mini-title">What:</span> Carefully designed public-domain books written by women in free, contemporary editions for print and web. </p>
    <p><span class="mini-title">How:</span> <span class="blue">cita</span> is a collaborative labor of love between designers and writers that relies on public-domain writings and open-source texts, fonts, code, and images. All the content of <span class="blue">cita</span> is either public-domain, or is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons License CC-NC-SA 4.0</a>, meaning it’s free forever, and sharable for non-commercial purposes so long as you can share if you say who created it. For example, we use <a href="https://github.com/evnbr/bindery">Bindery</a> by Evan Brooks. For more details, check the <a href="pages/collaborate.html" data-title="Collaborate">collaborate page</a>.</p>
    <p><span class="mini-title">Why:</span> Women authors have historically been underrepresented and underpublicized in the male-dominated, profit-driven publishing industry. We make these women writers’ works accessible to all, in free editions. While the work we have published so far is by women, we are interested in publishing work by writers whose genders have been historically marginalized in the publishing and literary landscape.</p>
    <p><span class="mini-title">Who:</span> <span class="blue">cita</span> is fiscally sponsored by Educopia and financially supported by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Read more about <a href="https://educopia.org/cita-press-getting-fit/">Cita Press - Getting Fit</a>, a two-year project project aimed at improving citation capacity and creating a business strategy for the press. <span class="blue">cita</span> was created by <a href="http://julianacastro.co">Juliana Castro</a>. <span class="blue">cita</span>'s Project and Editorial Coordinator is Jessi Haley.
