  <p><i>Ten Days in a Mad-House</i> brings together Nellie Bly's reporting from
  her first undercover assignment, which she undertook for the <i>New York World
  </i>in 1887 at just 23 years old. She disguised herself as "a crazy person" in
  order to get herself admitted to the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's
  Island (now Roosevelt's Island). She spent ten days there as a patient before
  the World secured her release. Her articles led to a grand jury investigation
  and an overhaul of the budget of the New York State asylums.</p>


  <p>While Bly's assignments were often framed as stunts— by her paper and others—<i>Ten Day</i>s is a serious examination of what can happen to women that society finds inconvenient (whether or not they have an illness). Bly deploys her trademark observational humor here, trained on the absurdity of the institution and the people who uphold its abuses. Cita's edition positions this landmark text within the tradition of feminist literature about women's experiences with mental illness, mental health treatment, and in mental institutions.
