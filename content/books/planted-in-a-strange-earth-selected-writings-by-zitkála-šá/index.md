  <i>“To have [Zitkála-Šá’s] work collected here now speaks to the tenacity of
  her spirit, her insistence on being heard across generations. Speaking of
  herself, of her world, she teaches us how to be now.” <b>–Erin Marie Lynch,
  foreword</i></b>


  <i>Planted in a Strange Earth: Selected Writings by Zitkála-Šá</i> brings together fiction, nonfiction, and poetry by one of the most influential yet underappreciated activist-artists of the twentieth century. Zitkála-Šá (also known as Gertrude Simmons Bonnin, 1876-1938) spent her early years on the Yankton Indian Reservation before becoming a pupil, teacher, and reluctant poster child of the Indian boarding school system. Her first national publications marked a definitive break with the oppressive ideas behind her education, and her early fame as a musician and writer evolved into a decades-long political career fighting for Native rights. 


  The collection focuses on the author’s writing on assimilationist projects of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and their impact within Native communities and individuals. Zitkála-Šá’s voice is lyrical, bold and fresh–even over 100 years after initial publication. Her writing captures the intense beauty and pain of growing up and explores what it means to forge an identity in the face of cultural erasure. These are essential feminist texts that dig into the cruel tensions of an era through the eyes of an author who spent a lifetime “actively testing the chains which tightly bound [her] individuality like a mummy for burial.”

## Foreword by Erin Marie Lynch

I first saw a photo of Zitkála-Šá in my early twenties, during an effort to locate literary ancestors among my tribal lineage. In the photo, now on the cover of this collection, she stands adorned in regalia, profile luminous, hand lifted to her forehead as if to see far off. Her image arrested me, and, upon reading American Indian Stories on Project Gutenberg, her work drew me in further. In her writing, I observed how distillations of childhood's minute, peculiar sensations remain undiluted by time–ice floats on the river like glass marbles, while shadows of clouds move across the hills. Zitkála-Šá, I further discovered, had lived briefly on Standing Rock Indian Reservation at the same time as my own family. I was overcome by this connection between us, emanating not just from Ihanktuƞwaƞ Dakota kinship but from physical proximity. I felt an emotional relation, even spiritual, the way one might encounter a benevolent natural presence. “The guardian star in the night sky beamed compassionately down,” as she writes in the story “The Trial Path.”

Now, I want to consider her not as an icon or lodestar—though she is those things, and though our people do come from the stars—but as a Ihanktuƞwaƞ Dakota woman. Born on the Yankton Reservation in 1876, twelve years before the Treaty of Fort Laramie, Zitkála-Šá attended missionary boarding schools, learned Latin, came home, left again, trained as a violinist, fell in love, wrote poetry, fiction, treatises, librettos, autobiography—the first Native woman to be published for writing about her own life—published, moved, fell in love again, moved again, lost hope, found hope, gave birth, founded the National Council of American Indians, orated, wrote pamphlets, moved again. She died at age sixty one in Washington D.C., far from the reservation, in the center of American civic life. “It was as if I were the activity, and my hands and feet were only experiments for my spirit to work upon,” she writes of her early years in “Impressions of an American Indian Childhood.” Her whole life, her whole endless output, might be seen in this way, as a series of “experiments for \[her] spirit to work upon.” Relentless, energetic, boundlessly curious–she was the activity.

Zitkála-Šá’s life and work entwined with her era's cataclysmic shifts; indeed, many of her formative experiences were shaped by the political projects of those who sought to eradicate the history and culture of Native communities. Reading her work, I follow the emotional traces of the sudden, brutal rendings that our people endured at this time. “I seemed to hang in the heart of chaos, beyond the touch or voice of human aid,” she writes of her attempt to return to her mother’s home after boarding school. No longer integrated into her community, yet unwilling and unable to assimilate into American culture, she becomes "a slender tree...uprooted from my mother, nature, and God. I was shorn of my branches, which had waved in sympathy and love for home and friends. The natural coat of bark which had protected my oversensitive nature was scraped off to the very quick. Now a cold bare pole I seemed to be, planted in a strange earth." From the moment she left her home as an eight-year-old, she occupied a dislocated, interstitial space, a position of exile becoming more and more common among Native people.

As her exile demands, Zitkála-Šá's writing can feel cold, mournful, bare. Upon finding her daughter inconsolably caught in this “heart of chaos,” her mother wanders out into the hills: “I was suddenly aroused by a loud cry piercing the night. It was my mother's voice wailing among the barren hills which held the bones of buried warriors. She called aloud for her brothers' spirits to support her in her helpless misery. My fingers icy cold, as I realized that my unrestrained tears had betrayed my suffering to her, and she was grieving for me.” This wail, this wordless cry, reverberates throughout much of Zitkála-Šá’s work. She grieves for her mother, grieves for the buried warriors, for the barren hills, for the betrayal of tears, for the suffering—and she grieves for herself. But might we consider this sustained mourning, this insistence upon grief's dramatization, to also be an act of defiance? She did not mourn in quiet; rather, she transformed grief into lyric, published it in newspapers and magazines, and forced her oppressors to publicly confront their doing. 

And grief can remain stagnant; Zitkála-Šá was never that. No—she was the activity. Ever an activist, she dedicated her career to Native people, fiercely championing our causes. Whatever moral position she claimed, she claimed unswervingly, advocating in letters, treatises, and speeches. She taught at, then disavowed, Carlisle Indian School, publicly censuring Henry Pratt’s assimilationist project in fiction, poems, and nonfiction. Employed for a time by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, she later fought for its dissolution. She wrote an essay entitled “Why I am a Pagan,” a clear and tender elucidation of Dakota spirituality; later, she became a devout Catholic, committed to planting churches on the reservations. Zitkála-Šá's shifting allegiances, I think, reveal the difficulty of moving through a world devoted to one's eradication, the disillusionment and strain of fighting both from within and outside of institutions. Her aim to “render service to the Red Race” remained unchanged, though at times she doubted the success of her efforts. “It is even a most strenuous effort to stand still and hold fast the small grounds that have been gained,” she wrote in a 1935 letter, “\[but] I do not regret the try I made…” Zitkála-Šá, née Gertrude Simmons: a self-created myth with a self-given name, steadfast in her quest to better the situation of Native people.

Above all, I want to situate Zitkála-Šá's writing within Dakota Ohúŋkaŋkaŋ, the storytelling practice we have used for thousands of years to preserve memory, to share the Dakota way, and to combat loneliness and loss. In “Impressions…,” she provides a vivid scene of listening to “the old people" as they told stories of Iktómi, the trickster. As the storytellers worked their magic, she says, "the bright flames leaped up into the faces of the old folks as they sat around in a great circle"; "the increasing interest of the tale aroused me, and I sat up eagerly listening to every word." While not a traditional storyteller herself, Zitkála-Šá learned from those evenings, gathered around that fire. Like a Dakota storyteller, she knew how to create suspense, how to pace a scene, and how to use a story to reveal truth. And she learned from the Iktómi stories, too, to be wary of the forms he might take. In her own writing, Zitkála-Šá's awareness of tone and context can shift, adapting her rhetoric as needed to suit an audience of White suffragists or Catholic bishops. I take these choices as strategy, enactment of her own trickery, using her abilities to outsmart Iktómi in his many guises. 

In her work, too, I locate our tradition of communal listening. “While one was telling of some heroic deed recently done by a near relative, the rest of us listened attentively, and exclaimed in undertones, ‘Han! han!’ (yes! yes!) whenever the speaker paused for breath.” This quality of listening–the assent whispered into the pause–carries forward in Zitkála-Šá's faithful, expressive renderings of life with her people. She lends her careful attention to the sounds of their laughter, the lines on their faces, the square patterns in their beadwork. Honoring the tradition of Dakota stories that came before hers, she folds their music into her own. Her particular voice has been made possible only by an attentive listening; in the pause she enacts, in her affirmation, I am able to hear a collective Dakota voice.

As a Dakota woman writing today, I seek always to inhabit my own contradictions, while moving toward the sense of belonging that Paula Gunn Allen calls “enwholement". As I look for my own mothers, at whose feet I might sit, I am thankful for Zitkála-Šá. It is an honor to learn from the inflections of her tone and from her breath. But Zitkála-Šá's words have much to offer to any reader, Native or non-Native, who is perhaps encountering her work for the first time, as I did all those years ago. To have her work collected here speaks to the tenacity of her spirit, her insistence on being heard across generations. Writing of herself, of her world, she teaches us how to be now. In this pause, I say: haƞ, haƞ.
