    "title": "The Yellow Wall-Paper",
    "author": "Charlotte Perkins Gilman",
    "book-paragraph": "Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wall-Paper” (1892) holds an important place among rediscovered works by turn-of-the-century American women writers for its bold critique of gender politics in a patriarchal society. The nameless narrator, undergoing the infamous rest cure for what doctors now diagnose as postpartum depression, experiences debilitating psychological effects.  At first repulsed by the wallpaper in the room where she is sequestered in a country estate, the narrator comes to like it as she vows to decode its pattern—she imagines many women creeping behind bars and identifies with one trapped woman, arguably a reflection of her painful position as a woman in Victorian America. Many of the story’s first readers considered it a psychological horror tale in the fashion of Poe.",

The novel emerged from obscurity like a different kind of storm: taking the literary world to new heights and awareness of what women writers could do.",

This essay was published anonymously in the Westminster Review in 1856, and was Evans’ first publication, right before before adopting the pen name for which she would become known: George Eliot.",

But my explanation is addressed to readers in whom I have no right to expect a previous knowledge of psychology, particularly in its more modern developments. I have therefore based my explanation of the problems of aesthetics as much as possible upon mental facts familiar, or at all events easily intelligible, to the lay reader.",

  "behind-a-mask": {
    "title": "Behind a Mask",
    "author": "Louisa May Alcott",
    "book-paragraph": "This novella was first published in 1866 under the pseudonym of A. M. Barnard in The Flag of Our Union. Set in Victorian era Britain, the story follows Jean Muir, the deceitful governess of the wealthy Coventry family. With expert manipulation, Jean Muir obtains the love, respect, and eventually the fortune of the Coventry family.<br/>Since it was republished by Madeleine B. Stern in 1975, the novel has become important in critical reinterpretation of Alcott's corpus of works and literary importance. Many literary critics treat the novel; for example, one critic treated the novel as a version of the \"Beauty and the Beast\" trope, while others provide feminist critiques of the narrative. Alcott's treatment of themes like acting, social class, and the struggle for agency all inform these larger discussions by critics. (Wikipedia)",
