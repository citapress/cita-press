    <h2>
      Preface
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a book of stories. For that reason I have excluded all purely
      lyrical poems. But the word "stories" has been stretched to its fullest
      application. It includes both narrative poems, properly so called; tales
      divided into scenes; and a few pieces of less obvious story-telling import
      in which one might say that the dramatis personae are air, clouds, trees,
      houses, streets, and such like things.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has long been a favourite idea of mine that the rhythms of 'vers libre'
      have not been sufficiently plumbed, that there is in them a power of
      variation which has never yet been brought to the light of experiment. I
      think it was the piano pieces of Debussy, with their strange likeness to
      short vers libre poems, which first showed me the close kinship of music
      and poetry, and there flashed into my mind the idea of using the movement
      of poetry in somewhat the same way that the musician uses the movement of
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite evident that this could never be done in the strict pattern
      of a metrical form, but the flowing, fluctuating rhythm of vers libre
      seemed to open the door to such an experiment. First, however, I
      considered the same method as applied to the more pronounced movements of
      natural objects. If the reader will turn to the poem, "A Roxbury Garden",
      he will find in the first two sections an attempt to give the circular
      movement of a hoop bowling along the ground, and the up and down,
      elliptical curve of a flying shuttlecock.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these experiments, it is but a step to the flowing rhythm of music.
      In "The Cremona Violin", I have tried to give this flowing, changing
      rhythm to the parts in which the violin is being played. The effect is
      farther heightened, because the rest of the poem is written in the seven
      line Chaucerian stanza; and, by deserting this ordered pattern for the
      undulating line of vers libre, I hoped to produce something of the suave,
      continuous tone of a violin. Again, in the violin parts themselves, the
      movement constantly changes, as will be quite plain to any one reading
      these passages aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      In "The Cremona Violin", however, the rhythms are fairly obvious and
      regular. I set myself a far harder task in trying to transcribe the
      various movements of Stravinsky's "Three Pieces 'Grotesques', for String
      Quartet". Several musicians, who have seen the poem, think the movement
      accurately given.
    </p>
    <p>
      These experiments lead me to believe that there is here much food for
      thought and matter for study, and I hope many poets will follow me in
      opening up the still hardly explored possibilities of vers libre.
    </p>
    <p>
      A good many of the poems in this book are written in "polyphonic prose". A
      form about which I have written and spoken so much that it seems hardly
      necessary to explain it here. Let me hastily add, however, that the word
      "prose" in its name refers only to the typographical arrangement, for in
      no sense is this a prose form. Only read it aloud, Gentle Reader, I beg,
      and you will see what you will see. For a purely dramatic form, I know
      none better in the whole range of poetry. It enables the poet to give his
      characters the vivid, real effect they have in a play, while at the same
      time writing in the 'decor'.
    </p>
    <p>
      One last innovation I have still to mention. It will be found in "Spring
      Day", and more fully enlarged upon in the series, "Towns in Colour". In
      these poems, I have endeavoured to give the colour, and light, and shade,
      of certain places and hours, stressing the purely pictorial effect, and
      with little or no reference to any other aspect of the places described.
      It is an enchanting thing to wander through a city looking for its
      unrelated beauty, the beauty by which it captivates the sensuous sense of
      seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always loved aquariums, but for years I went to them and looked,
      and looked, at those swirling, shooting, looping patterns of fish, which
      always defied transcription to paper until I hit upon the "unrelated"
      method. The result is in "An Aquarium". I think the first thing which
      turned me in this direction was John Gould Fletcher's "London Excursion",
      in "Some Imagist Poets". I here record my thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the substance of the poems&mdash;why, the poems are here. No one
      writing to-day can fail to be affected by the great war raging in Europe
      at this time. We are too near it to do more than touch upon it. But,
      obliquely, it is suggested in many of these poems, most notably those in
      the section, "Bronze Tablets". The Napoleonic Era is an epic subject, and
      waits a great epic poet. I have only been able to open a few windows upon
      it here and there. But the scene from the windows is authentic, and the
      watcher has used eyes, and ears, and heart, in watching.

      FIGURINES IN OLD SAXE
    </h2>
    <h2>
      Patterns
    </h2>
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   I walk down the garden paths,
   And all the daffodils
   Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.
   I walk down the patterned garden-paths
   In my stiff, brocaded gown.
   With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,
   I too am a rare
   Pattern.  As I wander down
   The garden paths.

   My dress is richly figured,
   And the train
   Makes a pink and silver stain
   On the gravel, and the thrift
   Of the borders.
   Just a plate of current fashion,
   Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.
   Not a softness anywhere about me,
   Only whalebone and brocade.
   And I sink on a seat in the shade
   Of a lime tree.  For my passion
   Wars against the stiff brocade.
   The daffodils and squills
   Flutter in the breeze
   As they please.
   And I weep;
   For the lime-tree is in blossom
   And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.

   And the plashing of waterdrops
   In the marble fountain
   Comes down the garden-paths.
   The dripping never stops.
   Underneath my stiffened gown
   Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,
   A basin in the midst of hedges grown
   So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,
   But she guesses he is near,
   And the sliding of the water
   Seems the stroking of a dear
   Hand upon her.
   What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!
   I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.
   All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.

   I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the paths,
   And he would stumble after,
   Bewildered by my laughter.
   I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles
     on his shoes.
   I would choose
   To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,
   A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,
   Till he caught me in the shade,
   And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,
   Aching, melting, unafraid.
   With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,
   And the plopping of the waterdrops,
   All about us in the open afternoon&mdash;
   I am very like to swoon
   With the weight of this brocade,
   For the sun sifts through the shade.

   Underneath the fallen blossom
   In my bosom,
   Is a letter I have hid.
   It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.
   "Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell
   Died in action Thursday se'nnight."
   As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,
   The letters squirmed like snakes.
   "Any answer, Madam," said my footman.
   "No," I told him.
   "See that the messenger takes some refreshment.
   No, no answer."
   And I walked into the garden,
   Up and down the patterned paths,
   In my stiff, correct brocade.
   The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,
   Each one.
   I stood upright too,
   Held rigid to the pattern
   By the stiffness of my gown.
   Up and down I walked,
   Up and down.

   In a month he would have been my husband.
   In a month, here, underneath this lime,
   We would have broke the pattern;
   He for me, and I for him,
   He as Colonel, I as Lady,
   On this shady seat.
   He had a whim
   That sunlight carried blessing.
   And I answered, "It shall be as you have said."
   Now he is dead.

   In Summer and in Winter I shall walk
   Up and down
   The patterned garden-paths
   In my stiff, brocaded gown.
   The squills and daffodils
   Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.
   I shall go
   Up and down,
   In my gown.
   Gorgeously arrayed,
   Boned and stayed.
   And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace
   By each button, hook, and lace.
   For the man who should loose me is dead,
   Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,
   In a pattern called a war.
   Christ!  What are patterns for?

    <h2>
      The Cross-Roads
    </h2>
    <p>
      A bullet through his heart at dawn. On the table a letter signed with a
      woman's name. A wind that goes howling round the house, and weeping as in
      shame. Cold November dawn peeping through the windows, cold dawn creeping
      over the floor, creeping up his cold legs, creeping over his cold body,
      creeping across his cold face. A glaze of thin yellow sunlight on the
      staring eyes. Wind howling through bent branches. A wind which never dies
      down. Howling, wailing. The gazing eyes glitter in the sunlight. The lids
      are frozen open and the eyes glitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thudding of a pick on hard earth. A spade grinding and crunching.
      Overhead, branches writhing, winding, interlacing, unwinding, scattering;
      tortured twinings, tossings, creakings. Wind flinging branches apart,
      drawing them together, whispering and whining among them. A waning,
      lopsided moon cutting through black clouds. A stream of pebbles and earth
      and the empty spade gleams clear in the moonlight, then is rammed again
      into the black earth. Tramping of feet. Men and horses. Squeaking of
      wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whoa! Ready, Jim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something falls, settles, is still. Suicides have no coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give us the stake, Jim. Now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Pound! Pound!
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll never walk. Nailed to the ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      An ash stick pierces his heart, if it buds the roots will hold him. He is
      a part of the earth now, clay to clay. Overhead the branches sway, and
      writhe, and twist in the wind. He'll never walk with a bullet in his
      heart, and an ash stick nailing him to the cold, black ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Six months he lay still. Six months. And the water welled up in his body,
      and soft blue spots chequered it. He lay still, for the ash stick held him
      in place. Six months! Then her face came out of a mist of green. Pink and
      white and frail like Dresden china, lilies-of-the-valley at her breast,
      puce-coloured silk sheening about her. Under the young green leaves, the
      horse at a foot-pace, the high yellow wheels of the chaise scarcely
      turning, her face, rippling like grain a-blowing, under her puce-coloured
      bonnet; and burning beside her, flaming within his correct blue coat and
      brass buttons, is someone. What has dimmed the sun? The horse steps on a
      rolling stone; a wind in the branches makes a moan. The little leaves
      tremble and shake, turn and quake, over and over, tearing their stems.
      There is a shower of young leaves, and a sudden-sprung gale wails in the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yellow-wheeled chaise is rocking&mdash;rocking, and all the branches
      are knocking&mdash;knocking. The sun in the sky is a flat, red plate, the
      branches creak and grate. She screams and cowers, for the green foliage is
      a lowering wave surging to smother her. But she sees nothing. The stake
      holds firm. The body writhes, the body squirms. The blue spots widen, the
      flesh tears, but the stake wears well in the deep, black ground. It holds
      the body in the still, black ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years! The body has been in the ground two years. It is worn away; it
      is clay to clay. Where the heart moulders, a greenish dust, the stake is
      thrust. Late August it is, and night; a night flauntingly jewelled with
      stars, a night of shooting stars and loud insect noises. Down the road to
      Tilbury, silence&mdash;and the slow flapping of large leaves. Down the
      road to Sutton, silence&mdash;and the darkness of heavy-foliaged trees.
      Down the road to Wayfleet, silence&mdash;and the whirring scrape of
      insects in the branches. Down the road to Edgarstown, silence&mdash;and
      stars like stepping-stones in a pathway overhead. It is very quiet at the
      cross-roads, and the sign-board points the way down the four roads,
      endlessly points the way where nobody wishes to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      A horse is galloping, galloping up from Sutton. Shaking the wide, still
      leaves as he goes under them. Striking sparks with his iron shoes;
      silencing the katydids. Dr. Morgan riding to a child-birth over Tilbury
      way; riding to deliver a woman of her first-born son. One o'clock from
      Wayfleet bell tower, what a shower of shooting stars! And a breeze all of
      a sudden, jarring the big leaves and making them jerk up and down. Dr.
      Morgan's hat is blown from his head, the horse swerves, and curves away
      from the sign-post. An oath&mdash;spurs&mdash;a blurring of grey mist. A
      quick left twist, and the gelding is snorting and racing down the Tilbury
      road with the wind dropping away behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stake has wrenched, the stake has started, the body, flesh from flesh,
      has parted. But the bones hold tight, socket and ball, and clamping them
      down in the hard, black ground is the stake, wedged through ribs and
      spine. The bones may twist, and heave, and twine, but the stake holds them
      still in line. The breeze goes down, and the round stars shine, for the
      stake holds the fleshless bones in line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty years now! Twenty long years! The body has powdered itself away; it
      is clay to clay. It is brown earth mingled with brown earth. Only flaky
      bones remain, lain together so long they fit, although not one bone is
      knit to another. The stake is there too, rotted through, but upright
      still, and still piercing down between ribs and spine in a straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yellow stillness is on the cross-roads, yellow stillness is on the trees.
      The leaves hang drooping, wan. The four roads point four yellow ways,
      saffron and gamboge ribbons to the gaze. A little swirl of dust blows up
      Tilbury road, the wind which fans it has not strength to do more; it
      ceases, and the dust settles down. A little whirl of wind comes up Tilbury
      road. It brings a sound of wheels and feet. The wind reels a moment and
      faints to nothing under the sign-post. Wind again, wheels and feet louder.
      Wind again&mdash;again&mdash;again. A drop of rain, flat into the dust.
      Drop!&mdash;Drop! Thick heavy raindrops, and a shrieking wind bending the
      great trees and wrenching off their leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the black sky, bowed and dripping with rain, up Tilbury road, comes
      the procession. A funeral procession, bound for the graveyard at Wayfleet.
      Feet and wheels&mdash;feet and wheels. And among them one who is carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bones in the deep, still earth shiver and pull. There is a quiver
      through the rotted stake. Then stake and bones fall together in a little
      puffing of dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like meshes of linked steel the rain shuts down behind the procession, now
      well along the Wayfleet road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wavers like smoke in the buffeting wind. His fingers blow out like
      smoke, his head ripples in the gale. Under the sign-post, in the pouring
      rain, he stands, and watches another quavering figure drifting down the
      Wayfleet road. Then swiftly he streams after it. It flickers among the
      trees. He licks out and winds about them. Over, under, blown, contorted.
      Spindrift after spindrift; smoke following smoke. There is a wailing
      through the trees, a wailing of fear, and after it laughter&mdash;laughter&mdash;laughter,
      skirling up to the black sky. Lightning jags over the funeral procession.
      A heavy clap of thunder. Then darkness and rain, and the sound of feet and
      wheels.

    <h2>
      A Roxbury Garden
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       I

     Hoops

   Blue and pink sashes,
   Criss-cross shoes,
   Minna and Stella run out into the garden
   To play at hoop.

   Up and down the garden-paths they race,
   In the yellow sunshine,
   Each with a big round hoop
   White as a stripped willow-wand.

   Round and round turn the hoops,
   Their diamond whiteness cleaving the yellow sunshine.
   The gravel crunches and squeaks beneath them,
   And a large pebble springs them into the air
   To go whirling for a foot or two
   Before they touch the earth again
   In a series of little jumps.

   Spring, Hoops!
   Spit out a shower of blue and white brightness.
   The little criss-cross shoes twinkle behind you,
   The pink and blue sashes flutter like flags,
   The hoop-sticks are ready to beat you.
   Turn, turn, Hoops!  In the yellow sunshine.
   Turn your stripped willow whiteness
   Along the smooth paths.

   Stella sings:
      "Round and round, rolls my hoop,
      Scarcely touching the ground,
      With a swoop,
      And a bound,
      Round and round.
      With a bumpety, crunching, scattering sound,
      Down the garden it flies;
      In our eyes
      The sun lies.
      See it spin
      Out and in;
      Through the paths it goes whirling,
      About the beds curling.
      Sway now to the loop,
      Faster, faster, my hoop.
      Round you come,
      Up you come,
      Quick and straight as before.
      Run, run, my hoop, run,
      Away from the sun."

   And the great hoop bounds along the path,
   Leaping into the wind-bright air.

   Minna sings:
      "Turn, hoop,
      Burn hoop,
      Twist and twine
      Hoop of mine.
      Flash along,
      Leap along,
      Right at the sun.
      Run, hoop, run.
      Faster and faster,
      Whirl, twirl.
      Wheel like fire,
      And spin like glass;
      Fire's no whiter
      Glass is no brighter.
      Dance,
      Prance,
      Over and over,
      About and about,
      With the top of you under,
      And the bottom at top,
      But never a stop.
      Turn about, hoop, to the tap of my stick,
      I follow behind you
      To touch and remind you.
      Burn and glitter, so white and quick,
      Round and round, to the tap of a stick."

   The hoop flies along between the flower-beds,
   Swaying the flowers with the wind of its passing.

   Beside the foxglove-border roll the hoops,
   And the little pink and white bells shake and jingle
   Up and down their tall spires;
   They roll under the snow-ball bush,
   And the ground behind them is strewn with white petals;
   They swirl round a corner,
   And jar a bee out of a Canterbury bell;
   They cast their shadows for an instant
   Over a bed of pansies,
   Catch against the spurs of a columbine,
   Jostle the quietness from a cluster of monk's-hood.
   Pat! Pat! behind them come the little criss-cross shoes,
   And the blue and pink sashes stream out in flappings of colour.

   Stella sings:
      "Hoop, hoop,
      Roll along,
      Faster bowl along,
      Hoop.
      Slow, to the turning,
      Now go!&mdash;Go!
      Quick!
      Here's the stick.
      Rat-a-tap-tap it,
      Pat it, flap it.
      Fly like a bird or a yellow-backed bee,
      See how soon you can reach that tree.
      Here is a path that is perfectly straight.
      Roll along, hoop, or we shall be late."

   Minna sings:
      "Trip about, slip about, whip about
      Hoop.
      Wheel like a top at its quickest spin,
      Then, dear hoop, we shall surely win.
      First to the greenhouse and then to the wall
      Circle and circle,
      And let the wind push you,
      Poke you,
      Brush you,
      And not let you fall.
      Whirring you round like a wreath of mist.
      Hoopety hoop,
      Twist,
      Twist."

   Tap! Tap! go the hoop-sticks,
   And the hoops bowl along under a grape arbour.
   For an instant their willow whiteness is green,
   Pale white-green.
   Then they are out in the sunshine,
   Leaving the half-formed grape clusters
   A-tremble under their big leaves.

   "I will beat you, Minna," cries Stella,
   Hitting her hoop smartly with her stick.
   "Stella, Stella, we are winning," calls Minna,
   As her hoop curves round a bed of clove-pinks.
   A humming-bird whizzes past Stella's ear,
   And two or three yellow-and-black butterflies
   Flutter, startled, out of a pillar rose.
   Round and round race the little girls
   After their great white hoops.

   Suddenly Minna stops.
   Her hoop wavers an instant,
   But she catches it up on her stick.
   "Listen, Stella!"
   Both the little girls are listening;
   And the scents of the garden rise up quietly about them.
   "It's the chaise!  It's Father!
   Perhaps he's brought us a book from Boston."
   Twinkle, twinkle, the little criss-cross shoes
   Up the garden path.
   Blue&mdash;pink&mdash;an instant, against the syringa hedge.
   But the hoops, white as stripped willow-wands,
   Lie in the grass,
   And the grasshoppers jump back and forth
   Over them.

     Battledore and Shuttlecock

   The shuttlecock soars upward
   In a parabola of whiteness,
   Turns,
   And sinks to a perfect arc.
   Plat! the battledore strikes it,
   And it rises again,
   Without haste,
   Winged and curving,
   Tracing its white flight
   Against the clipped hemlock-trees.
   Plat!
   Up again,
   Orange and sparkling with sun,
   Rounding under the blue sky,
   Dropping,
   Fading to grey-green
   In the shadow of the coned hemlocks.
   "Ninety-one."  "Ninety-two."  "Ninety-three."
   The arms of the little girls
   Come up&mdash;and up&mdash;
   Precisely,
   Like mechanical toys.
   The battledores beat at nothing,
   And toss the dazzle of snow
   Off their parchment drums.
   "Ninety-four."  Plat!
   "Ninety-five."  Plat!
   Back and forth
   Goes the shuttlecock,
   Icicle-white,
   Leaping at the sharp-edged clouds,
   Overturning,
   Falling,
   Down,
   And down,
   Tinctured with pink
   From the upthrusting shine
   Of Oriental poppies.

   The little girls sway to the counting rhythm;
   Left foot,
   Right foot.
   Plat!  Plat!
   Yellow heat twines round the handles of the battledores,
   The parchment cracks with dryness;
   But the shuttlecock
   Swings slowly into the ice-blue sky,
   Heaving up on the warm air
   Like a foam-bubble on a wave,
   With feathers slanted and sustaining.
   Higher,
   Until the earth turns beneath it;
   Poised and swinging,
   With all the garden flowing beneath it,
   Scarlet, and blue, and purple, and white&mdash;
   Blurred colour reflections in rippled water&mdash;
   Changing&mdash;streaming&mdash;
   For the moment that Stella takes to lift her arm.
   Then the shuttlecock relinquishes,
   Bows,
   Descends;
   And the sharp blue spears of the air
   Thrust it to earth.

   Again it mounts,
   Stepping up on the rising scents of flowers,
   Buoyed up and under by the shining heat.
   Above the foxgloves,
   Above the guelder-roses,
   Above the greenhouse glitter,
   Till the shafts of cooler air
   Meet it,
   Deflect it,
   Reject it,
   Then down,
   Down,
   Past the greenhouse,
   Past the guelder-rose bush,
   Past the foxgloves.

   "Ninety-nine," Stella's battledore springs to the impact.
   Plunk!  Like the snap of a taut string.
   "Oh!  Minna!"
   The shuttlecock drops zigzagedly,
   Out of orbit,
   Hits the path,
   And rolls over quite still.
   Dead white feathers,
   With a weight at the end.

     Garden Games

   The tall clock is striking twelve;
   And the little girls stop in the hall to watch it,
   And the big ships rocking in a half-circle
   Above the dial.
   Twelve o'clock!
   Down the side steps
   Go the little girls,
   Under their big round straw hats.
   Minna's has a pink ribbon,
   Stella's a blue,
   That is the way they know which is which.
   Twelve o'clock!
   An hour yet before dinner.
   Mother is busy in the still-room,
   And Hannah is making gingerbread.

   Slowly, with lagging steps,
   They follow the garden-path,
   Crushing a leaf of box for its acrid smell,
   Discussing what they shall do,
   And doing nothing.

   "Stella, see that grasshopper
   Climbing up the bank!
   What a jump!
   Almost as long as my arm."
   Run, children, run.
   For the grasshopper is leaping away,
   In half-circle curves,
   Shuttlecock curves,
   Over the grasses.
   Hand in hand, the little girls call to him:
      "Grandfather, grandfather gray,
      Give me molasses, or I'll throw you away."

   The grasshopper leaps into the sunlight,
   Golden-green,
   And is gone.

   "Let's catch a bee."
   Round whirl the little girls,
   And up the garden.
   Two heads are thrust among the Canterbury bells,
   Listening,
   And fingers clasp and unclasp behind backs
   In a strain of silence.

   White bells,
   Blue bells,
   Hollow and reflexed.
   Deep tunnels of blue and white dimness,
   Cool wine-tunnels for bees.
   There is a floundering and buzzing over Minna's head.

   "Bend it down, Stella.  Quick!  Quick!"
   The wide mouth of a blossom
   Is pressed together in Minna's fingers.
   The stem flies up, jiggling its flower-bells,
   And Minna holds the dark blue cup in her hand,
   With the bee
   Imprisoned in it.
   Whirr! Buzz! Bump!
   Bump! Whiz! Bang!
   BANG!!
   The blue flower tears across like paper,
   And a gold-black bee darts away in the sunshine.

   "If we could fly, we could catch him."
   The sunshine is hot on Stella's upturned face,
   As she stares after the bee.
   "We'll follow him in a dove chariot.
   Come on, Stella."
   Run, children,
   Along the red gravel paths,
   For a bee is hard to catch,
   Even with a chariot of doves.

   Tall, still, and cowled,
   Stand the monk's-hoods;
   Taller than the heads of the little girls.
   A blossom for Minna.
   A blossom for Stella.
   Off comes the cowl,
   And there is a purple-painted chariot;
   Off comes the forward petal,
   And there are two little green doves,
   With green traces tying them to the chariot.
   "Now we will get in, and fly right up to the clouds.
      Fly, Doves, up in the sky,
      With Minna and me,
      After the bee."

   Up one path,
   Down another,
   Run the little girls,
   Holding their dove chariots in front of them;
   But the bee is hidden in the trumpet of a honeysuckle,
   With his wings folded along his back.

   The dove chariots are thrown away,
   And the little girls wander slowly through the garden,
   Sucking the salvia tips,
   And squeezing the snapdragons
   To make them gape.
   "I'm so hot,
   Let's pick a pansy
   And see the little man in his bath,
   And play we're he."
   A royal bath-tub,
   Hung with purple stuffs and yellow.
   The great purple-yellow wings
   Rise up behind the little red and green man;
   The purple-yellow wings fan him,
   He dabbles his feet in cool green.
   Off with the green sheath,
   And there are two spindly legs.
   "Heigho!" sighs Minna.
   "Heigho!" sighs Stella.
   There is not a flutter of wind,
   And the sun is directly overhead.

   Along the edge of the garden
   Walk the little girls.
   Their hats, round and yellow like cheeses,
   Are dangling by the ribbons.
   The grass is a tumult of buttercups and daisies;
   Buttercups and daisies streaming away
   Up the hill.
   The garden is purple, and pink, and orange, and scarlet;
   The garden is hot with colours.
   But the meadow is only yellow, and white, and green,
   Cool, and long, and quiet.
   The little girls pick buttercups
   And hold them under each other's chins.
   "You're as gold as Grandfather's snuff-box.
   You're going to be very rich, Minna."
   "Oh-o-o!  Then I'll ask my husband to give me a pair of garnet earrings
   Just like Aunt Nancy's.
   I wonder if he will.
   I know.  We'll tell fortunes.
   That's what we'll do."
   Plump down in the meadow grass,
   Stella and Minna,
   With their round yellow hats,
   Like cheeses,
   Beside them.
   Drop,
   Drop,
   Daisy petals.
      "One I love,
      Two I love,
      Three I love I say..."
   The ground is peppered with daisy petals,
   And the little girls nibble the golden centres,
   And play it is cake.

   A bell rings.
   Dinner-time;
   And after dinner there are lessons.

     The Trumpet-Vine Arbour

   The throats of the little red trumpet-flowers are wide open,
   And the clangour of brass beats against the hot sunlight.
   They bray and blare at the burning sky.
   Red!  Red!  Coarse notes of red,
   Trumpeted at the blue sky.
   In long streaks of sound, molten metal,
   The vine declares itself.
   Clang!&mdash;from its red and yellow trumpets.
   Clang!&mdash;from its long, nasal trumpets,
   Splitting the sunlight into ribbons, tattered and shot with noise.

   I sit in the cool arbour, in a green-and-gold twilight.
   It is very still, for I cannot hear the trumpets,
   I only know that they are red and open,
   And that the sun above the arbour shakes with heat.
   My quill is newly mended,
   And makes fine-drawn lines with its point.
   Down the long, white paper it makes little lines,
   Just lines&mdash;up&mdash;down&mdash;criss-cross.
   My heart is strained out at the pin-point of my quill;
   It is thin and writhing like the marks of the pen.
   My hand marches to a squeaky tune,
   It marches down the paper to a squealing of fifes.
   My pen and the trumpet-flowers,
   And Washington's armies away over the smoke-tree to the Southwest.
   "Yankee Doodle," my Darling!  It is you against the British,
   Marching in your ragged shoes to batter down King George.
   What have you got in your hat?  Not a feather, I wager.
   Just a hay-straw, for it is the harvest you are fighting for.
   Hay in your hat, and the whites of their eyes for a target!
   Like Bunker Hill, two years ago, when I watched all day from the house-top
   Through Father's spy-glass.
   The red city, and the blue, bright water,
   And puffs of smoke which you made.
   Twenty miles away,
   Round by Cambridge, or over the Neck,
   But the smoke was white&mdash;white!
   To-day the trumpet-flowers are red&mdash;red&mdash;
   And I cannot see you fighting,
   But old Mr. Dimond has fled to Canada,
   And Myra sings "Yankee Doodle" at her milking.
   The red throats of the trumpets bray and clang in the sunshine,
   And the smoke-tree puffs dun blossoms into the blue air.

     The City of Falling Leaves

   Leaves fall,
   Brown leaves,
   Yellow leaves streaked with brown.
   They fall,
   Flutter,
   Fall again.
   The brown leaves,
   And the streaked yellow leaves,
   Loosen on their branches
   And drift slowly downwards.
   One,
   One, two, three,
   One, two, five.
   All Venice is a falling of Autumn leaves&mdash;
   Brown,
   And yellow streaked with brown.

   "That sonnet, Abate,
   Beautiful,
   I am quite exhausted by it.
   Your phrases turn about my heart
   And stifle me to swooning.
   Open the window, I beg.
   Lord!  What a strumming of fiddles and mandolins!
   'Tis really a shame to stop indoors.
   Call my maid, or I will make you lace me yourself.
   Fie, how hot it is, not a breath of air!
   See how straight the leaves are falling.
   Marianna, I will have the yellow satin caught up with silver fringe,
   It peeps out delightfully from under a mantle.
   Am I well painted to-day, 'caro Abate mio'?
   You will be proud of me at the 'Ridotto', hey?
   Proud of being 'Cavalier Servente' to such a lady?"
   "Can you doubt it, 'Bellissima Contessa'?
   A pinch more rouge on the right cheek,
   And Venus herself shines less..."
   "You bore me, Abate,
   I vow I must change you!
   A letter, Achmet?
   Run and look out of the window, Abate.
   I will read my letter in peace."
   The little black slave with the yellow satin turban
   Gazes at his mistress with strained eyes.
   His yellow turban and black skin
   Are gorgeous&mdash;barbaric.
   The yellow satin dress with its silver flashings
   Lies on a chair
   Beside a black mantle and a black mask.
   Yellow and black,
   Gorgeous&mdash;barbaric.
   The lady reads her letter,
   And the leaves drift slowly
   Past the long windows.
   "How silly you look, my dear Abate,
   With that great brown leaf in your wig.
   Pluck it off, I beg you,
   Or I shall die of laughing."

   A yellow wall
   Aflare in the sunlight,
   Chequered with shadows,
   Shadows of vine leaves,
   Shadows of masks.
   Masks coming, printing themselves for an instant,
   Then passing on,
   More masks always replacing them.
   Masks with tricorns and rapiers sticking out behind
   Pursuing masks with plumes and high heels,
   The sunlight shining under their insteps.
   One,
   One, two,
   One, two, three,
   There is a thronging of shadows on the hot wall,
   Filigreed at the top with moving leaves.
   Yellow sunlight and black shadows,
   Yellow and black,
   Gorgeous&mdash;barbaric.
   Two masks stand together,
   And the shadow of a leaf falls through them,
   Marking the wall where they are not.
   From hat-tip to shoulder-tip,
   From elbow to sword-hilt,
   The leaf falls.
   The shadows mingle,
   Blur together,
   Slide along the wall and disappear.
   Gold of mosaics and candles,
   And night blackness lurking in the ceiling beams.
   Saint Mark's glitters with flames and reflections.
   A cloak brushes aside,
   And the yellow of satin
   Licks out over the coloured inlays of the pavement.
   Under the gold crucifixes
   There is a meeting of hands
   Reaching from black mantles.
   Sighing embraces, bold investigations,
   Hide in confessionals,
   Sheltered by the shuffling of feet.
   Gorgeous&mdash;barbaric
   In its mail of jewels and gold,
   Saint Mark's looks down at the swarm of black masks;
   And outside in the palace gardens brown leaves fall,
   Flutter,
   Fall.
   Brown,
   And yellow streaked with brown.

   Blue-black, the sky over Venice,
   With a pricking of yellow stars.
   There is no moon,
   And the waves push darkly against the prow
   Of the gondola,
   Coming from Malamocco
   And streaming toward Venice.
   It is black under the gondola hood,
   But the yellow of a satin dress
   Glares out like the eye of a watching tiger.
   Yellow compassed about with darkness,
   Yellow and black,
   Gorgeous&mdash;barbaric.
   The boatman sings,
   It is Tasso that he sings;
   The lovers seek each other beneath their mantles,
   And the gondola drifts over the lagoon, aslant to the coming dawn.
   But at Malamocco in front,
   In Venice behind,
   Fall the leaves,
   Brown,
   And yellow streaked with brown.
   They fall,
   Flutter,
   Fall.

    <h2>
      The Fruit Shop
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Cross-ribboned shoes; a muslin gown,
   High-waisted, girdled with bright blue;
   A straw poke bonnet which hid the frown
   She pluckered her little brows into
   As she picked her dainty passage through
   The dusty street.  "Ah, Mademoiselle,
   A dirty pathway, we need rain,
   My poor fruits suffer, and the shell
   Of this nut's too big for its kernel, lain
   Here in the sun it has shrunk again.
   The baker down at the corner says
   We need a battle to shake the clouds;
   But I am a man of peace, my ways
   Don't look to the killing of men in crowds.
   Poor fellows with guns and bayonets for shrouds!
   Pray, Mademoiselle, come out of the sun.
   Let me dust off that wicker chair.  It's cool
   In here, for the green leaves I have run
   In a curtain over the door, make a pool
   Of shade.  You see the pears on that stool&mdash;
   The shadow keeps them plump and fair."
   Over the fruiterer's door, the leaves
   Held back the sun, a greenish flare
   Quivered and sparked the shop, the sheaves
   Of sunbeams, glanced from the sign on the eaves,
   Shot from the golden letters, broke
   And splintered to little scattered lights.
   Jeanne Tourmont entered the shop, her poke
   Bonnet tilted itself to rights,
   And her face looked out like the moon on nights
   Of flickering clouds.  "Monsieur Popain, I
   Want gooseberries, an apple or two,
   Or excellent plums, but not if they're high;
   Haven't you some which a strong wind blew?
   I've only a couple of francs for you."
   Monsieur Popain shrugged and rubbed his hands.
   What could he do, the times were sad.
   A couple of francs and such demands!
   And asking for fruits a little bad.
   Wind-blown indeed!  He never had
   Anything else than the very best.
   He pointed to baskets of blunted pears
   With the thin skin tight like a bursting vest,
   All yellow, and red, and brown, in smears.
   Monsieur Popain's voice denoted tears.
   He took up a pear with tender care,
   And pressed it with his hardened thumb.
   "Smell it, Mademoiselle, the perfume there
   Is like lavender, and sweet thoughts come
   Only from having a dish at home.
   And those grapes!  They melt in the mouth like wine,
   Just a click of the tongue, and they burst to honey.
   They're only this morning off the vine,
   And I paid for them down in silver money.
   The Corporal's widow is witness, her pony
   Brought them in at sunrise to-day.
   Those oranges&mdash;Gold!  They're almost red.
   They seem little chips just broken away
   From the sun itself.  Or perhaps instead
   You'd like a pomegranate, they're rarely gay,
   When you split them the seeds are like crimson spray.
   Yes, they're high, they're high, and those Turkey figs,
   They all come from the South, and Nelson's ships
   Make it a little hard for our rigs.
   They must be forever giving the slips
   To the cursed English, and when men clips
   Through powder to bring them, why dainties mounts
   A bit in price.  Those almonds now,
   I'll strip off that husk, when one discounts
   A life or two in a nigger row
   With the man who grew them, it does seem how
   They would come dear; and then the fight
   At sea perhaps, our boats have heels
   And mostly they sail along at night,
   But once in a way they're caught; one feels
   Ivory's not better nor finer&mdash;why peels
   From an almond kernel are worth two sous.
   It's hard to sell them now," he sighed.
   "Purses are tight, but I shall not lose.
   There's plenty of cheaper things to choose."
   He picked some currants out of a wide
   Earthen bowl.  "They make the tongue
   Almost fly out to suck them, bride
   Currants they are, they were planted long
   Ago for some new Marquise, among
   Other great beauties, before the Chateau
   Was left to rot.  Now the Gardener's wife,
   He that marched off to his death at Marengo,
   Sells them to me; she keeps her life
   From snuffing out, with her pruning knife.
   She's a poor old thing, but she learnt the trade
   When her man was young, and the young Marquis
   Couldn't have enough garden.  The flowers he made
   All new!  And the fruits!  But 'twas said that he
   Was no friend to the people, and so they laid
   Some charge against him, a cavalcade
   Of citizens took him away; they meant
   Well, but I think there was some mistake.
   He just pottered round in his garden, bent
   On growing things; we were so awake
   In those days for the New Republic's sake.
   He's gone, and the garden is all that's left
   Not in ruin, but the currants and apricots,
   And peaches, furred and sweet, with a cleft
   Full of morning dew, in those green-glazed pots,
   Why, Mademoiselle, there is never an eft
   Or worm among them, and as for theft,
   How the old woman keeps them I cannot say,
   But they're finer than any grown this way."
   Jeanne Tourmont drew back the filigree ring
   Of her striped silk purse, tipped it upside down
   And shook it, two coins fell with a ding
   Of striking silver, beneath her gown
   One rolled, the other lay, a thing
   Sparked white and sharply glistening,
   In a drop of sunlight between two shades.
   She jerked the purse, took its empty ends
   And crumpled them toward the centre braids.
   The whole collapsed to a mass of blends
   Of colours and stripes.  "Monsieur Popain, friends
   We have always been.  In the days before
   The Great Revolution my aunt was kind
   When you needed help.  You need no more;
   'Tis we now who must beg at your door,
   And will you refuse?"  The little man
   Bustled, denied, his heart was good,
   But times were hard.  He went to a pan
   And poured upon the counter a flood
   Of pungent raspberries, tanged like wood.
   He took a melon with rough green rind
   And rubbed it well with his apron tip.
   Then he hunted over the shop to find
   Some walnuts cracking at the lip,
   And added to these a barberry slip
   Whose acrid, oval berries hung
   Like fringe and trembled.  He reached a round
   Basket, with handles, from where it swung
   Against the wall, laid it on the ground
   And filled it, then he searched and found
   The francs Jeanne Tourmont had let fall.
   "You'll return the basket, Mademoiselle?"
   She smiled, "The next time that I call,
   Monsieur.  You know that very well."
   'Twas lightly said, but meant to tell.
   Monsieur Popain bowed, somewhat abashed.
   She took her basket and stepped out.
   The sunlight was so bright it flashed
   Her eyes to blindness, and the rout
   Of the little street was all about.
   Through glare and noise she stumbled, dazed.
   The heavy basket was a care.
   She heard a shout and almost grazed
   The panels of a chaise and pair.
   The postboy yelled, and an amazed
   Face from the carriage window gazed.
   She jumped back just in time, her heart
   Beating with fear.  Through whirling light
   The chaise departed, but her smart
   Was keen and bitter.  In the white
   Dust of the street she saw a bright
   Streak of colours, wet and gay,
   Red like blood.  Crushed but fair,
   Her fruit stained the cobbles of the way.
   Monsieur Popain joined her there.
   "Tiens, Mademoiselle,
         c'est le General Bonaparte, partant pour la Guerre!"

    <h2>
      Malmaison
    </h2>
    <p>
      I
    </p>
    <p>
      How the slates of the roof sparkle in the sun, over there, over there,
      beyond the high wall! How quietly the Seine runs in loops and windings,
      over there, over there, sliding through the green countryside! Like ships
      of the line, stately with canvas, the tall clouds pass along the sky, over
      the glittering roof, over the trees, over the looped and curving river. A
      breeze quivers through the linden-trees. Roses bloom at Malmaison. Roses!
      Roses! But the road is dusty. Already the Citoyenne Beauharnais wearies of
      her walk. Her skin is chalked and powdered with dust, she smells dust, and
      behind the wall are roses! Roses with smooth open petals, poised above
      rippling leaves... Roses ... They have told her so. The Citoyenne
      Beauharnais shrugs her shoulders and makes a little face. She must mend
      her pace if she would be back in time for dinner. Roses indeed! The
      guillotine more likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tiered clouds float over Malmaison, and the slate roof sparkles in the
      sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      II
    </p>
    <p>
      Gallop! Gallop! The General brooks no delay. Make way, good people, and
      scatter out of his path, you, and your hens, and your dogs, and your
      children. The General is returned from Egypt, and is come in a 'caleche'
      and four to visit his new property. Throw open the gates, you, Porter of
      Malmaison. Pull off your cap, my man, this is your master, the husband of
      Madame. Faster! Faster! A jerk and a jingle and they are arrived, he and
      she. Madame has red eyes. Fie! It is for joy at her husband's return.
      Learn your place, Porter. A gentleman here for two months? Fie! Fie, then!
      Since when have you taken to gossiping. Madame may have a brother, I
      suppose. That&mdash;all green, and red, and glitter, with flesh as dark as
      ebony&mdash;that is a slave; a bloodthirsty, stabbing, slashing heathen,
      come from the hot countries to cure your tongue of idle whispering.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fine afternoon it is, with tall bright clouds sailing over the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bonaparte, mon ami, the trees are golden like my star, the star I pinned
      to your destiny when I married you. The gypsy, you remember her prophecy!
      My dear friend, not here, the servants are watching; send them away, and
      that flashing splendour, Roustan. Superb&mdash;Imperial, but.. . My dear,
      your arm is trembling; I faint to feel it touching me! No, no, Bonaparte,
      not that&mdash;spare me that&mdash;did we not bury that last night! You
      hurt me, my friend, you are so hot and strong. Not long, Dear, no, thank
      God, not long."
    </p>
    <p>
      The looped river runs saffron, for the sun is setting. It is getting dark.
      Dark. Darker. In the moonlight, the slate roof shines palely milkily
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roses have faded at Malmaison, nipped by the frost. What need for
      roses? Smooth, open petals&mdash;her arms. Fragrant, outcurved petals&mdash;her
      breasts. He rises like a sun above her, stooping to touch the petals,
      press them wider. Eagles. Bees. What are they to open roses! A little
      shivering breeze runs through the linden-trees, and the tiered clouds blow
      across the sky like ships of the line, stately with canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      III
    </p>
    <p>
      The gates stand wide at Malmaison, stand wide all day. The gravel of the
      avenue glints under the continual rolling of wheels. An officer gallops up
      with his sabre clicking; a mameluke gallops down with his charger kicking.
      'Valets de pied' run about in ones, and twos, and groups, like swirled
      blown leaves. Tramp! Tramp! The guard is changing, and the grenadiers off
      duty lounge out of sight, ranging along the roads toward Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slate roof sparkles in the sun, but it sparkles milkily, vaguely, the
      great glass-houses put out its shining. Glass, stone, and onyx now for the
      sun's mirror. Much has come to pass at Malmaison. New rocks and fountains,
      blocks of carven marble, fluted pillars uprearing antique temples, vases
      and urns in unexpected places, bridges of stone, bridges of wood, arbours
      and statues, and a flood of flowers everywhere, new flowers, rare flowers,
      parterre after parterre of flowers. Indeed, the roses bloom at Malmaison.
      It is youth, youth untrammeled and advancing, trundling a country ahead of
      it as though it were a hoop. Laughter, and spur janglings in tessellated
      vestibules. Tripping of clocked and embroidered stockings in little
      low-heeled shoes over smooth grass-plots. India muslins spangled with
      silver patterns slide through trees&mdash;mingle&mdash;separate&mdash;white
      day fireflies flashing moon-brilliance in the shade of foliage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The kangaroos! I vow, Captain, I must see the kangaroos."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please, dear Lady, but I recommend the shady linden alley and
      feeding the cockatoos."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say that Madame Bonaparte's breed of sheep is the best in all
      France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, oh, have you seen the enchanting little cedar she planted when the
      First Consul sent home the news of the victory of Marengo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Picking, choosing, the chattering company flits to and fro. Over the trees
      the great clouds go, tiered, stately, like ships of the line bright with
      canvas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prisoners'-base, and its swooping, veering, racing, giggling, bumping. The
      First Consul runs plump into M. de Beauharnais and falls. But he picks
      himself up smartly, and starts after M. Isabey. Too late, M. Le Premier
      Consul, Mademoiselle Hortense is out after you. Quickly, my dear Sir! Stir
      your short legs, she is swift and eager, and as graceful as her mother.
      She is there, that other, playing too, but lightly, warily, bearing
      herself with care, rather floating out upon the air than running, never
      far from goal. She is there, borne up above her guests as something
      indefinably fair, a rose above periwinkles. A blown rose, smooth as satin,
      reflexed, one loosened petal hanging back and down. A rose that undulates
      languorously as the breeze takes it, resting upon its leaves in a
      faintness of perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are rumours about the First Consul. Malmaison is full of women, and
      Paris is only two leagues distant. Madame Bonaparte stands on the wooden
      bridge at sunset, and watches a black swan pushing the pink and silver
      water in front of him as he swims, crinkling its smoothness into pleats of
      changing colour with his breast. Madame Bonaparte presses against the
      parapet of the bridge, and the crushed roses at her belt melt, petal by
      petal, into the pink water.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV
    </p>
    <p>
      A vile day, Porter. But keep your wits about you. The Empress will soon be
      here. Queer, without the Emperor! It is indeed, but best not consider
      that. Scratch your head and prick up your ears. Divorce is not for you to
      debate about. She is late? Ah, well, the roads are muddy. The rain spears
      are as sharp as whetted knives. They dart down and down, edged and
      shining. Clop-trop! Clop-trop! A carriage grows out of the mist. Hist,
      Porter. You can keep on your hat. It is only Her Majesty's dogs and her
      parrot. Clop-trop! The Ladies in Waiting, Porter. Clop-trop! It is Her
      Majesty. At least, I suppose it is, but the blinds are drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In all the years I have served Her Majesty she never before passed the
      gate without giving me a smile!"
    </p>
    <p>
      You're a droll fellow, to expect the Empress to put out her head in the
      pouring rain and salute you. She has affairs of her own to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clang the gate, no need for further waiting, nobody else will be coming to
      Malmaison to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      White under her veil, drained and shaking, the woman crosses the
      antechamber. Empress! Empress! Foolish splendour, perished to dust. Ashes
      of roses, ashes of youth. Empress forsooth!
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the glass domes of the hot-houses drenches the rain. Behind her a
      clock ticks&mdash;ticks again. The sound knocks upon her thought with the
      echoing shudder of hollow vases. She places her hands on her ears, but the
      minutes pass, knocking. Tears in Malmaison. And years to come each
      knocking by, minute after minute. Years, many years, and tears, and cold
      pouring rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel as though I had died, and the only sensation I have is that I am
      no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rain! Heavy, thudding rain!
    </p>
    <p>
      V
    </p>
    <p>
      The roses bloom at Malmaison. And not only roses. Tulips, myrtles,
      geraniums, camelias, rhododendrons, dahlias, double hyacinths. All the
      year through, under glass, under the sky, flowers bud, expand, die, and
      give way to others, always others. From distant countries they have been
      brought, and taught to live in the cool temperateness of France. There is
      the 'Bonapartea' from Peru; the 'Napoleone Imperiale'; the 'Josephinia
      Imperatrix', a pearl-white flower, purple-shadowed, the calix pricked out
      with crimson points. Malmaison wears its flowers as a lady wears her gems,
      flauntingly, assertively. Malmaison decks herself to hide the hollow
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glass-houses grow and grow, and every year fling up hotter reflections
      to the sailing sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cost runs into millions, but a woman must have something to console
      herself for a broken heart. One can play backgammon and patience, and then
      patience and backgammon, and stake gold napoleons on each game won. Sport
      truly! It is an unruly spirit which could ask better. With her jewels, her
      laces, her shawls; her two hundred and twenty dresses, her fichus, her
      veils; her pictures, her busts, her birds. It is absurd that she cannot be
      happy. The Emperor smarts under the thought of her ingratitude. What could
      he do more? And yet she spends, spends as never before. It is ridiculous.
      Can she not enjoy life at a smaller figure? Was ever monarch plagued with
      so extravagant an ex-wife. She owes her chocolate-merchant, her
      candle-merchant, her sweetmeat purveyor; her grocer, her butcher, her
      poulterer; her architect, and the shopkeeper who sells her rouge; her
      perfumer, her dressmaker, her merchant of shoes. She owes for fans,
      plants, engravings, and chairs. She owes masons and carpenters, vintners,
      lingeres. The lady's affairs are in sad confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And why? Why?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can a river flow when the spring is dry?
    </p>
    <p>
      Night. The Empress sits alone, and the clock ticks, one after one. The
      clock nicks off the edges of her life. She is chipped like an old bit of
      china; she is frayed like a garment of last year's wearing. She is soft,
      crinkled, like a fading rose. And each minute flows by brushing against
      her, shearing off another and another petal. The Empress crushes her
      breasts with her hands and weeps. And the tall clouds sail over Malmaison
      like a procession of stately ships bound for the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarlet, clear-blue, purple epauletted with gold. It is a parade of
      soldiers sweeping up the avenue. Eight horses, eight Imperial harnesses,
      four caparisoned postilions, a carriage with the Emperor's arms on the
      panels. Ho, Porter, pop out your eyes, and no wonder. Where else under the
      Heavens could you see such splendour!
    </p>
    <p>
      They sit on a stone seat. The little man in the green coat of a Colonel of
      Chasseurs, and the lady, beautiful as a satin seed-pod, and as pale. The
      house has memories. The satin seed-pod holds his germs of Empire. We will
      stay here, under the blue sky and the turreted white clouds. She draws
      him; he feels her faded loveliness urge him to replenish it. Her soft
      transparent texture woos his nervous fingering. He speaks to her of debts,
      of resignation; of her children, and his; he promises that she shall see
      the King of Rome; he says some harsh things and some pleasant. But she is
      there, close to him, rose toned to amber, white shot with violet, pungent
      to his nostrils as embalmed rose-leaves in a twilit room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the Emperor calls his carriage and rolls away across the looping
      Seine.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI
    </p>
    <p>
      Crystal-blue brightness over the glass-houses. Crystal-blue streaks and
      ripples over the lake. A macaw on a gilded perch screams; they have
      forgotten to take out his dinner. The windows shake. Boom! Boom! It is the
      rumbling of Prussian cannon beyond Pecq. Roses bloom at Malmaison. Roses!
      Roses! Swimming above their leaves, rotting beneath them. Fallen flowers
      strew the unraked walks. Fallen flowers for a fallen Emperor! The General
      in charge of him draws back and watches. Snatches of music&mdash;snarling,
      sneering music of bagpipes. They say a Scotch regiment is besieging
      Saint-Denis. The Emperor wipes his face, or is it his eyes. His tired eyes
      which see nowhere the grace they long for. Josephine! Somebody asks him a
      question, he does not answer, somebody else does that. There are voices,
      but one voice he does not hear, and yet he hears it all the time.
      Josephine! The Emperor puts up his hand to screen his face. The white
      light of a bright cloud spears sharply through the linden-trees. 'Vive
      l'Empereur!' There are troops passing beyond the wall, troops which sing
      and call. Boom! A pink rose is jarred off its stem and falls at the
      Emperor's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. I go." Where! Does it matter? There is no sword to clatter.
      Nothing but soft brushing gravel and a gate which shuts with a click.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick, fellow, don't spare your horses."
    </p>
    <p>
      A whip cracks, wheels turn, why burn one's eyes following a fleck of dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      VII
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the slate roof tall clouds, like ships of the line, pass along the
      sky. The glass-houses glitter splotchily, for many of their lights are
      broken. Roses bloom, fiery cinders quenching under damp weeds. Wreckage
      and misery, and a trailing of petty deeds smearing over old recollections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The musty rooms are empty and their shutters are closed, only in the
      gallery there is a stuffed black swan, covered with dust. When you touch
      it, the feathers come off and float softly to the ground. Through a chink
      in the shutters, one can see the stately clouds crossing the sky toward
      the Roman arches of the Marly Aqueduct.

      The Hammers
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
       I

     Frindsbury, Kent, 1786

   Bang!
   Bang!
   Tap!
   Tap-a-tap!  Rap!
   All through the lead and silver Winter days,
   All through the copper of Autumn hazes.
   Tap to the red rising sun,
   Tap to the purple setting sun.
   Four years pass before the job is done.
   Two thousand oak trees grown and felled,
   Two thousand oaks from the hedgerows of the Weald,
   Sussex had yielded two thousand oaks
   With huge boles
   Round which the tape rolls
   Thirty mortal feet, say the village folks.
   Two hundred loads of elm and Scottish fir;
   Planking from Dantzig.
   My!  What timber goes into a ship!
   Tap!  Tap!
   Two years they have seasoned her ribs on the ways,
   Tapping, tapping.
   You can hear, though there's nothing where you gaze.
   Through the fog down the reaches of the river,
   The tapping goes on like heart-beats in a fever.
   The church-bells chime
   Hours and hours,
   Dropping days in showers.
   Bang!  Rap!  Tap!
   Go the hammers all the time.
   They have planked up her timbers
   And the nails are driven to the head;
   They have decked her over,
   And again, and again.
   The shoring-up beams shudder at the strain.
   Black and blue breeches,
   Pigtails bound and shining:
   Like ants crawling about,
   The hull swarms with carpenters, running in and out.
   Joiners, calkers,
   And they are all terrible talkers.
   Jem Wilson has been to sea and he tells some wonderful tales
   Of whales, and spice islands,
   And pirates off the Barbary coast.
   He boasts magnificently, with his mouth full of nails.
   Stephen Pibold has a tenor voice,
   He shifts his quid of tobacco and sings:
       "The second in command was blear-eyed Ned:
          While the surgeon his limb was a-lopping,
       A nine-pounder came and smack went his head,
          Pull away, pull away, pull away!  I say;
          Rare news for my Meg of Wapping!"
   Every Sunday
   People come in crowds
   (After church-time, of course)
   In curricles, and gigs, and wagons,
   And some have brought cold chicken and flagons
   Of wine,
   And beer in stoppered jugs.
   "Dear!  Dear!  But I tell 'ee 'twill be a fine ship.
   There's none finer in any of the slips at Chatham."

   The third Summer's roses have started in to blow,
   When the fine stern carving is begun.
   Flutings, and twinings, and long slow swirls,
   Bits of deal shaved away to thin spiral curls.
   Tap!  Tap!  A cornucopia is nailed into place.
   Rap-a-tap!  They are putting up a railing filigreed like Irish lace.
   The Three Town's people never saw such grace.
   And the paint on it!  The richest gold leaf!
   Why, the glitter when the sun is shining passes belief.
   And that row of glass windows tipped toward the sky
   Are rubies and carbuncles when the day is dry.
   Oh, my!  Oh, my!
   They have coppered up the bottom,
   And the copper nails
   Stand about and sparkle in big wooden pails.
   Bang!  Clash!  Bang!
       "And he swigg'd, and Nick swigg'd,
          And Ben swigg'd, and Dick swigg'd,
       And I swigg'd, and all of us swigg'd it,
          And swore there was nothing like grog."
   It seems they sing,
   Even though coppering is not an easy thing.
   What a splendid specimen of humanity is a true British workman,
   Say the people of the Three Towns,
   As they walk about the dockyard
   To the sound of the evening church-bells.
   And so artistic, too, each one tells his neighbour.
   What immense taste and labour!
   Miss Jessie Prime, in a pink silk bonnet,
   Titters with delight as her eyes fall upon it,
   When she steps lightly down from Lawyer Green's whisky;
   Such amazing beauty makes one feel frisky,
   She explains.
   Mr. Nichols says he is delighted
   (He is the firm);
   His work is all requited
   If Miss Jessie can approve.
   Miss Jessie answers that the ship is "a love".
   The sides are yellow as marigold,
   The port-lids are red when the ports are up:
   Blood-red squares like an even chequer
   Of yellow asters and portulaca.
   There is a wide "black strake" at the waterline
   And above is a blue like the sky when the weather is fine.
   The inner bulwarks are painted red.
   "Why?" asks Miss Jessie.  "'Tis a horrid note."
   Mr. Nichols clears his throat,
   And tells her the launching day is set.
   He says, "Be careful, the paint is wet."
   But Miss Jessie has touched it, her sprigged muslin gown
   Has a blood-red streak from the shoulder down.
   "It looks like blood," says Miss Jessie with a frown.

   Tap!  Tap!  Rap!
   An October day, with waves running in blue-white lines and a capful of wind.
   Three broad flags ripple out behind
   Where the masts will be:
   Royal Standard at the main,
   Admiralty flag at the fore,
   Union Jack at the mizzen.
   The hammers tap harder, faster,
   They must finish by noon.
   The last nail is driven.
   But the wind has increased to half a gale,
   And the ship shakes and quivers upon the ways.
   The Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard is coming
   In his ten-oared barge from the King's Stairs;
   The Marine's band will play "God Save Great George Our King";
   And there is to be a dinner afterwards at the Crown, with speeches.
   The wind screeches, and flaps the flags till they pound like hammers.
   The wind hums over the ship,
   And slips round the dog-shores,
   Jostling them almost to falling.
   There is no time now to wait for Commissioners and marine bands.
   Mr. Nichols has a bottle of port in his hands.
   He leans over, holding his hat, and shouts to the men below:
   "Let her go!"
   Bang!  Bang!  Pound!
   The dog-shores fall to the ground,
   And the ship slides down the greased planking.
   A splintering of glass,
   And port wine running all over the white and copper stem timbers.
   "Success to his Majesty's ship, the Bellerophon!"
   And the red wine washes away in the waters of the Medway.

       II

     Paris, March, 1814

   Fine yellow sunlight down the rue du Mont Thabor.
   Ten o'clock striking from all the clock-towers of Paris.
   Over the door of a shop, in gilt letters:
   "Martin&mdash;Parfumeur", and something more.
   A large gilded wooden something.
   Listen!  What a ringing of hammers!
   Tap!
   Tap!
   Squeak!
   Tap!  Squeak!  Tap-a-tap!
   "Blaise."
   "Oui, M'sieu."
   "Don't touch the letters.  My name stays."
   "Bien, M'sieu."
   "Just take down the eagle, and the shield with the bees."
   "As M'sieu pleases."
   Tap!  Squeak!  Tap!
   The man on the ladder hammers steadily for a minute or two,
   Then stops.
   "He!  Patron!
   They are fastened well, Nom d'un Chien!
   What if I break them?"
   "Break away,
   You and Paul must have them down to-day."
   "Bien."
   And the hammers start again,
   Drum-beating at the something of gilded wood.
   Sunshine in a golden flood
   Lighting up the yellow fronts of houses,
   Glittering each window to a flash.
   Squeak!  Squeak!  Tap!
   The hammers beat and rap.
   A Prussian hussar on a grey horse goes by at a dash.
   From other shops, the noise of striking blows:
   Pounds, thumps, and whacks;
   Wooden sounds:  splinters&mdash;cracks.
   Paris is full of the galloping of horses and the knocking of hammers.
   "Hullo! Friend Martin, is business slack
   That you are in the street this morning?  Don't turn your back
   And scuttle into your shop like a rabbit to its hole.
   I've just been taking a stroll.
   The stinking Cossacks are bivouacked all up and down the Champs Elysees.
   I can't get the smell of them out of my nostrils.
   Dirty fellows, who don't believe in frills
   Like washing.  Ah, mon vieux, you'd have to go
   Out of business if you lived in Russia.  So!
   We've given up being perfumers to the Emperor, have we?
   Blaise,
   Be careful of the hen,
   Maybe I can find a use for her one of these days.
   That eagle's rather well cut, Martin.
   But I'm sick of smelling Cossack,
   Take me inside and let me put my head into a stack
   Of orris-root and musk."
   Within the shop, the light is dimmed to a pearl-and-green dusk
   Out of which dreamily sparkle counters and shelves of glass,
   Containing phials, and bowls, and jars, and dishes; a mass
   Of aqueous transparence made solid by threads of gold.
   Gold and glass,
   And scents which whiff across the green twilight and pass.
   The perfumer sits down and shakes his head:
   "Always the same, Monsieur Antoine,
   You artists are wonderful folk indeed."
   But Antoine Vernet does not heed.
   He is reading the names on the bottles and bowls,
   Done in fine gilt letters with wonderful scrolls.
   "What have we here?  'Eau Imperial Odontalgique.'
   I must say, mon cher, your names are chic.
   But it won't do, positively it will not do.
   Elba doesn't count.  Ah, here is another:
   'Baume du Commandeur'.  That's better.  He needs something to smother
   Regrets.  A little lubricant, too,
   Might be useful.  I have it,
   'Sage Oil', perhaps he'll be good now; with it we'll submit
   This fine German rouge.  I fear he is pale."
   "Monsieur Antoine, don't rail
   At misfortune.  He treated me well and fairly."
   "And you prefer him to Bourbons, admit it squarely."
   "Heaven forbid!"  Bang!  Whack!
   Squeak!  Squeak!  Crack!
   CRASH!
   "Oh, Lord, Martin!  That shield is hash.
   The whole street is covered with golden bees.
   They look like so many yellow peas,
   Lying there in the mud.  I'd like to paint it.
   'Plum pudding of Empire'.  That's rather quaint, it
   Might take with the Kings.  Shall I try?"  "Oh, Sir,
   You distress me, you do."  "Poor old Martin's purr!
   But he hasn't a scratch in him, I know.
   Now let us get back to the powders and patches.
   Foolish man,
   The Kings are here now.  We must hit on a plan
   To change all these titles as fast as we can.
   'Bouquet Imperatrice'.  Tut!  Tut!  Give me some ink&mdash;
   'Bouquet de la Reine', what do you think?
   Not the same receipt?
   Now, Martin, put away your conceit.
   Who will ever know?
   'Extract of Nobility'&mdash;excellent, since most of them are killed."
   "But, Monsieur Antoine&mdash;"
   "You are self-willed,
   Martin.  You need a salve
   For your conscience, do you?
   Very well, we'll halve
   The compliments, also the pastes and dentifrices;
   Send some to the Kings, and some to the Empresses.
   'Oil of Bitter Almonds'&mdash;the Empress Josephine can have that.
   'Oil of Parma Violets' fits the other one pat."
   Rap!  Rap!  Bang!
   "What a hideous clatter!
   Blaise seems determined to batter
   That poor old turkey into bits,
   And pound to jelly my excellent wits.
   Come, come, Martin, you mustn't shirk.
   'The night cometh soon'&mdash;etc.  Don't jerk
   Me up like that.  'Essence de la Valliere'&mdash;
   That has a charmingly Bourbon air.
   And, oh! Magnificent!  Listen to this!&mdash;
   'Vinaigre des Quatre Voleurs'.  Nothing amiss
   With that&mdash;England, Austria, Russia and Prussia!
   Martin, you're a wonder,
   Upheavals of continents can't keep you under."
   "Monsieur Antoine, I am grieved indeed
   At such levity.  What France has gone through&mdash;"
   "Very true, Martin, very true,
   But never forget that a man must feed."
   Pound!  Pound!  Thump!
   Pound!
   "Look here, in another minute Blaise will drop that bird on the ground."
   Martin shrugs his shoulders.  "Ah, well, what then?&mdash;"
   Antoine, with a laugh:  "I'll give you two sous for that antiquated hen."
   The Imperial Eagle sells for two sous,
   And the lilies go up.
         A man must choose!

       III

     Paris, April, 1814

   Cold, impassive, the marble arch of the Place du Carrousel.
   Haughty, contemptuous, the marble arch of the Place du Carrousel.
   Like a woman raped by force, rising above her fate,
   Borne up by the cold rigidity of hate,
   Stands the marble arch of the Place du Carrousel.
   Tap!  Clink-a-tink!
   Tap!  Rap!  Chink!
   What falls to the ground like a streak of flame?
   Hush!  It is only a bit of bronze flashing in the sun.
   What are all those soldiers?  Those are not the uniforms of France.
   Alas!  No!  The uniforms of France, Great Imperial France, are done.
   They will rot away in chests and hang to dusty tatters in barn lofts.
   These are other armies.  And their name?
   Hush, be still for shame;
   Be still and imperturbable like the marble arch.
   Another bright spark falls through the blue air.
   Over the Place du Carrousel a wailing of despair.
   Crowd your horses back upon the people, Uhlans and Hungarian Lancers,
   They see too much.
   Unfortunately, Gentlemen of the Invading Armies, what they do not see,
     they hear.
   Tap!  Clink-a-tink!
   Tap!
   Another sharp spear
   Of brightness,
   And a ringing of quick metal lightness
   On hard stones.
   Workmen are chipping off the names of Napoleon's victories
   From the triumphal arch of the Place du Carrousel.

   Do they need so much force to quell the crowd?
   An old Grenadier of the line groans aloud,
   And each hammer tap points the sob of a woman.
   Russia, Prussia, Austria, and the faded-white-lily Bourbon king
   Think it well
   To guard against tumult,
   A mob is an undependable thing.
   Ding!  Ding!
   Vienna is scattered all over the Place du Carrousel
   In glittering, bent, and twisted letters.
   Your betters have clattered over Vienna before,
   Officer of his Imperial Majesty our Father-in-Law!
   Tink!  Tink!
   A workman's chisel can strew you to the winds,
   Munich.
   Do they think
   To pleasure Paris, used to the fall of cities,
   By giving her a fall of letters!

   It is a month too late.
   One month, and our lily-white Bourbon king
   Has done a colossal thing;
   He has curdled love,
   And soured the desires of a people.
   Still the letters fall,
   The workmen creep up and down their ladders like lizards on a wall.
   Tap!  Tap!  Tink!
   Clink!  Clink!
   "Oh, merciful God, they will not touch Austerlitz!
   Strike me blind, my God, my eyes can never look on that.
   I would give the other leg to save it, it took one.
   Curse them!  Curse them!  Aim at his hat.
   Give me the stone.  Why didn't you give it to me?
   I would not have missed.  Curse him!
   Curse all of them!  They have got the 'A'!"
   Ding!  Ding!
   "I saw the Terror, but I never saw so horrible a thing as this.
   'Vive l'Empereur!  Vive l'Empereur!'"
   "Don't strike him, Fritz.
   The mob will rise if you do.
   Just run him out to the 'quai',
   That will get him out of the way.
   They are almost through."
   Clink!  Tink!  Ding!
   Clear as the sudden ring
   Of a bell
   "Z" strikes the pavement.
   Farewell, Austerlitz, Tilsit, Presbourg;
   Farewell, greatness departed.
   Farewell, Imperial honours, knocked broadcast by the beating hammers
     of ignorant workmen.
   Straight, in the Spring moonlight,
   Rises the deflowered arch.
   In the silence, shining bright,
   She stands naked and unsubdued.
   Her marble coldness will endure the march
   Of decades.
   Rend her bronzes, hammers;
   Cast down her inscriptions.
   She is unconquerable, austere,
   Cold as the moon that swims above her
   When the nights are clear.

     Croissy, Ile-de-France, June, 1815

   "Whoa!  Victorine.
   Devil take the mare!  I've never seen so vicious a beast.
   She kicked Jules the last time she was here,
   He's been lame ever since, poor chap."
   Rap!  Tap!
   Tap-a-tap-a-tap!  Tap!  Tap!
   "I'd rather be lame than dead at Waterloo, M'sieu Charles."
   "Sacre Bleu!  Don't mention Waterloo, and the damned grinning British.
   We didn't run in the old days.
   There wasn't any running at Jena.
   Those were decent days,
   And decent men, who stood up and fought.
   We never got beaten, because we wouldn't be.
   See!"
   "You would have taught them, wouldn't you, Sergeant Boignet?
   But to-day it's everyone for himself,
   And the Emperor isn't what he was."
   "How the Devil do you know that?
   If he was beaten, the cause
   Is the green geese in his army, led by traitors.
   Oh, I say no names, Monsieur Charles,
   You needn't hammer so loud.
   If there are any spies lurking behind the bellows,
   I beg they come out.  Dirty fellows!"
   The old Sergeant seizes a red-hot poker
   And advances, brandishing it, into the shadows.
   The rows of horses flick
   Placid tails.
   Victorine gives a savage kick
   As the nails
   Go in.  Tap!  Tap!
   Jules draws a horseshoe from the fire
   And beats it from red to peacock-blue and black,
   Purpling darker at each whack.
   Ding!  Dang!  Dong!
   Ding-a-ding-dong!
   It is a long time since any one spoke.
   Then the blacksmith brushes his hand over his eyes,
   "Well," he sighs,
   "He's broke."
   The Sergeant charges out from behind the bellows.
   "It's the green geese, I tell you,
   Their hearts are all whites and yellows,
   There's no red in them.  Red!
   That's what we want.  Fouche should be fed
   To the guillotine, and all Paris dance the carmagnole.
   That would breed jolly fine lick-bloods
   To lead his armies to victory."
   "Ancient history, Sergeant.
   He's done."
   "Say that again, Monsieur Charles, and I'll stun
   You where you stand for a dung-eating Royalist."
   The Sergeant gives the poker a savage twist;
   He is as purple as the cooling horseshoes.
   The air from the bellows creaks through the flues.
   Tap!  Tap!  The blacksmith shoes Victorine,
   And through the doorway a fine sheen
   Of leaves flutters, with the sun between.
   By a spurt of fire from the forge
   You can see the Sergeant, with swollen gorge,
   Puffing, and gurgling, and choking;
   The bellows keep on croaking.
   They wheeze,
   And sneeze,
   Creak!  Bang!  Squeeze!
   And the hammer strokes fall like buzzing bees
   Or pattering rain,
   Or faster than these,
   Like the hum of a waterfall struck by a breeze.
   Clank! from the bellows-chain pulled up and down.
   Clank!
   And sunshine twinkles on Victorine's flank,
   Starting it to blue,
   Dropping it to black.
   Clack!  Clack!
   Tap-a-tap!  Tap!
   Lord!  What galloping!  Some mishap
   Is making that man ride so furiously.
   "Francois, you!
   Victorine won't be through
   For another quarter of an hour."  "As you hope to die,
   Work faster, man, the order has come."
   "What order?  Speak out.  Are you dumb?"
   "A chaise, without arms on the panels, at the gate
   In the far side-wall, and just to wait.
   We must be there in half an hour with swift cattle.
   You're a stupid fool if you don't hear that rattle.
   Those are German guns.  Can't you guess the rest?
   Nantes, Rochefort, possibly Brest."
   Tap!  Tap! as though the hammers were mad.
   Dang!  Ding!  Creak!  The farrier's lad
   Jerks the bellows till he cracks their bones,
   And the stifled air hiccoughs and groans.
   The Sergeant is lying on the floor
   Stone dead, and his hat with the tricolore
   Cockade has rolled off into the cinders.  Victorine snorts and lays back
     her ears.
   What glistens on the anvil?  Sweat or tears?

     St. Helena, May, 1821

   Tap!  Tap!  Tap!
   Through the white tropic night.
   Tap!  Tap!
   Beat the hammers,
   Unwearied, indefatigable.
   They are hanging dull black cloth about the dead.
   Lustreless black cloth
   Which chokes the radiance of the moonlight
   And puts out the little moving shadows of leaves.
   Tap!  Tap!
   The knocking makes the candles quaver,
   And the long black hangings waver
   Tap!  Tap!  Tap!
   Tap!  Tap!
   In the ears which do not heed.
   Tap!  Tap!
   Above the eyelids which do not flicker.
   Tap!  Tap!
   Over the hands which do not stir.
   Chiselled like a cameo of white agate against the hangings,
   Struck to brilliance by the falling moonlight,
   A face!
   Sharp as a frozen flame,
   Beautiful as an altar lamp of silver,
   And still.  Perfectly still.
   In the next room, the men chatter
   As they eat their midnight lunches.
   A knife hits against a platter.
   But the figure on the bed
   Between the stifling black hangings
   Is cold and motionless,
   Played over by the moonlight from the windows
   And the indistinct shadows of leaves.

   Tap!  Tap!
   Upholsterer Darling has a fine shop in Jamestown.
   Tap!  Tap!
   Andrew Darling has ridden hard from Longwood to see to the work in his shop
     in Jamestown.
   He has a corps of men in it, toiling and swearing,
   Knocking, and measuring, and planing, and squaring,
   Working from a chart with figures,
   Comparing with their rules,
   Setting this and that part together with their tools.
   Tap!  Tap!  Tap!
   Haste indeed!
   So great is the need
   That carpenters have been taken from the new church,
   Joiners have been called from shaping pews and lecterns
   To work of greater urgency.
   Coffins!
   Coffins is what they are making this bright Summer morning.
   Coffins&mdash;and all to measurement.
   There is a tin coffin,
   A deal coffin,
   A lead coffin,
   And Captain Bennett's best mahogany dining-table
   Has been sawed up for the grand outer coffin.
   Tap!  Tap!  Tap!
   Sunshine outside in the square,
   But inside, only hollow coffins and the tapping upon them.
   The men whistle,
   And the coffins grow under their hammers
   In the darkness of the shop.
   Tap!  Tap!  Tap!

   Tramp of men.
   Steady tramp of men.
   Slit-eyed Chinese with long pigtails
   Bearing oblong things upon their shoulders
   March slowly along the road to Longwood.
   Their feet fall softly in the dust of the road;
   Sometimes they call gutturally to each other and stop to shift shoulders.
   Four coffins for the little dead man,
   Four fine coffins,
   And one of them Captain Bennett's dining-table!
   And sixteen splendid Chinamen, all strong and able
   And of assured neutrality.
   Ah!  George of England, Lord Bathhurst &amp; Co.
   Your princely munificence makes one's heart glow.
   Huzza!  Huzza!  For the Lion of England!

   Tap!  Tap!  Tap!
   Marble likeness of an Emperor,
   Dead man, who burst your heart against a world too narrow,
   The hammers drum you to your last throne
   Which always you shall hold alone.
   Tap!  Tap!
   The glory of your past is faded as a sunset fire,
   Your day lingers only like the tones of a wind-lyre
   In a twilit room.
   Here is the emptiness of your dream
   Scattered about you.
   Coins of yesterday,
   Double napoleons stamped with Consul or Emperor,
   Strange as those of Herculaneum&mdash;
   And you just dead!
   Not one spool of thread
   Will these buy in any market-place.
   Lay them over him,
   They are the baubles of a crown of mist
   Worn in a vision and melted away at waking.
   Tap!  Tap!
   His heart strained at kingdoms
   And now it is content with a silver dish.
   Strange World!  Strange Wayfarer!
   Strange Destiny!
   Lower it gently beside him and let it lie.
   Tap!  Tap!  Tap!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Reign of Louis Philippe
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   A great tall column spearing at the sky
   With a little man on top.  Goodness!  Tell me why?
   He looks a silly thing enough to stand up there so high.

   What a strange fellow, like a soldier in a play,
   Tight-fitting coat with the tails cut away,
   High-crowned hat which the brims overlay.

   Two-horned hat makes an outline like a bow.
   Must have a sword, I can see the light glow
   Between a dark line and his leg.  Vertigo

   I get gazing up at him, a pygmy flashed with sun.
   A weathercock or scarecrow or both things in one?
   As bright as a jewelled crown hung above a throne.

   Say, what is the use of him if he doesn't turn?
   Just put up to glitter there, like a torch to burn,
   A sort of sacrificial show in a lofty urn?

   But why a little soldier in an obsolete dress?
   I'd rather see a Goddess with a spear, I confess.
   Something allegorical and fine.  Why, yes&mdash;

   I cannot take my eyes from him.  I don't know why at all.
   I've looked so long the whole thing swims.  I feel he ought to fall.
   Foreshortened there among the clouds he's pitifully small.

   What do you say?  There used to be an Emperor standing there,
   With flowing robes and laurel crown.  Really?  Yet I declare
   Those spiral battles round the shaft don't seem just his affair.

   A togaed, laurelled man's I mean.  Now this chap seems to feel
   As though he owned those soldiers.  Whew!  How he makes one reel,
   Swinging round above his circling armies in a wheel.

   Sweeping round the sky in an orbit like the sun's,
   Flashing sparks like cannon-balls from his own long guns.
   Perhaps my sight is tired, but that figure simply stuns.

   How low the houses seem, and all the people are mere flies.
   That fellow pokes his hat up till it scratches on the skies.
   Impudent!  Audacious!  But, by Jove, he blinds the eyes!

      August 14th, 1914
    </h3>
    <p>
      Into the brazen, burnished sky, the cry hurls itself. The zigzagging cry
      of hoarse throats, it floats against the hard winds, and binds the head of
      the serpent to its tail, the long snail-slow serpent of marching men. Men
      weighed down with rifles and knapsacks, and parching with war. The cry
      jars and splits against the brazen, burnished sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the war of wars, and the cause? Has this writhing worm of men a
      cause?
    </p>
    <p>
      Crackling against the polished sky is an eagle with a sword. The eagle is
      red and its head is flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the shoulder of the worm is a teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      His tongue laps the war-sucked air in drought, but he yells defiance at
      the red-eyed eagle, and in his ears are the bells of new philosophies, and
      their tinkling drowns the sputter of the burning sword. He shrieks, "God
      damn you! When you are broken, the word will strike out new shoots."
    </p>
    <p>
      His boots are tight, the sun is hot, and he may be shot, but he is in the
      shoulder of the worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dust speck in the worm's belly is a poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughs at the flaring eagle and makes a long nose with his fingers. He
      will fight for smooth, white sheets of paper, and uncurdled ink. The
      sputtering sword cannot make him blink, and his thoughts are wet and
      rippling. They cool his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He will tear the eagle out of the sky and give the earth tranquillity, and
      loveliness printed on white paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eye of the serpent is an owner of mills.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looks at the glaring sword which has snapped his machinery and struck
      away his men.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it will all come again, when the sword is broken to a million dying
      stars, and there are no more wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bankers, butchers, shop-keepers, painters, farmers&mdash;men, sway and
      sweat. They will fight for the earth, for the increase of the slow, sure
      roots of peace, for the release of hidden forces. They jibe at the eagle
      and his scorching sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      One! Two!&mdash;One! Two!&mdash;clump the heavy boots. The cry hurtles
      against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each man pulls his belt a little tighter, and shifts his gun to make it
      lighter. Each man thinks of a woman, and slaps out a curse at the eagle.
      The sword jumps in the hot sky, and the worm crawls on to the battle,
      stubbornly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the war of wars, from eye to tail the serpent has one cause:
      PEACE!

      The Bombardment
    </h2>
    <p>
      Slowly, without force, the rain drops into the city. It stops a moment on
      the carved head of Saint John, then slides on again, slipping and
      trickling over his stone cloak. It splashes from the lead conduit of a
      gargoyle, and falls from it in turmoil on the stones in the Cathedral
      square. Where are the people, and why does the fretted steeple sweep about
      in the sky? Boom! The sound swings against the rain. Boom, again! After
      it, only water rushing in the gutters, and the turmoil from the spout of
      the gargoyle. Silence. Ripples and mutters. Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
      The room is damp, but warm. Little flashes swarm about from the firelight.
      The lustres of the chandelier are bright, and clusters of rubies leap in
      the bohemian glasses on the 'etagere'. Her hands are restless, but the
      white masses of her hair are quite still. Boom! Will it never cease to
      torture, this iteration! Boom! The vibration shatters a glass on the
      'etagere'. It lies there, formless and glowing, with all its crimson
      gleams shot out of pattern, spilled, flowing red, blood-red. A thin
      bell-note pricks through the silence. A door creaks. The old lady speaks:
      "Victor, clear away that broken glass." "Alas! Madame, the bohemian
      glass!" "Yes, Victor, one hundred years ago my father brought it&mdash;"
      Boom! The room shakes, the servitor quakes. Another goblet shivers and
      breaks. Boom!

      It rustles at the window-pane, the smooth, streaming rain, and he is shut
      within its clash and murmur. Inside is his candle, his table, his ink, his
      pen, and his dreams. He is thinking, and the walls are pierced with beams
      of sunshine, slipping through young green. A fountain tosses itself up at
      the blue sky, and through the spattered water in the basin he can see
      copper carp, lazily floating among cold leaves. A wind-harp in a
      cedar-tree grieves and whispers, and words blow into his brain, bubbled,
      iridescent, shooting up like flowers of fire, higher and higher. Boom! The
      flame-flowers snap on their slender stems. The fountain rears up in long
      broken spears of dishevelled water and flattens into the earth. Boom! And
      there is only the room, the table, the candle, and the sliding rain.
      Again, Boom!&mdash;Boom!&mdash;Boom! He stuffs his fingers into his ears.
      He sees corpses, and cries out in fright. Boom! It is night, and they are
      shelling the city! Boom! Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
      A child wakes and is afraid, and weeps in the darkness. What has made the
      bed shake? "Mother, where are you? I am awake." "Hush, my Darling, I am
      here." "But, Mother, something so queer happened, the room shook." Boom!
      "Oh! What is it? What is the matter?" Boom! "Where is Father? I am so
      afraid." Boom! The child sobs and shrieks. The house trembles and creaks.
      Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
      Retorts, globes, tubes, and phials lie shattered. All his trials oozing
      across the floor. The life that was his choosing, lonely, urgent, goaded
      by a hope, all gone. A weary man in a ruined laboratory, that is his
      story. Boom! Gloom and ignorance, and the jig of drunken brutes. Diseases
      like snakes crawling over the earth, leaving trails of slime. Wails from
      people burying their dead. Through the window, he can see the rocking
      steeple. A ball of fire falls on the lead of the roof, and the sky tears
      apart on a spike of flame. Up the spire, behind the lacings of stone,
      zigzagging in and out of the carved tracings, squirms the fire. It spouts
      like yellow wheat from the gargoyles, coils round the head of Saint John,
      and aureoles him in light. It leaps into the night and hisses against the
      rain. The Cathedral is a burning stain on the white, wet night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boom! The Cathedral is a torch, and the houses next to it begin to scorch.
      Boom! The bohemian glass on the 'etagere' is no longer there. Boom! A
      stalk of flame sways against the red damask curtains. The old lady cannot
      walk. She watches the creeping stalk and counts. Boom!&mdash;Boom!&mdash;Boom!
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet rushes into the street, and the rain wraps him in a sheet of
      silver. But it is threaded with gold and powdered with scarlet beads. The
      city burns. Quivering, spearing, thrusting, lapping, streaming, run the
      flames. Over roofs, and walls, and shops, and stalls. Smearing its gold on
      the sky, the fire dances, lances itself through the doors, and lisps and
      chuckles along the floors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child wakes again and screams at the yellow petalled flower flickering
      at the window. The little red lips of flame creep along the ceiling beams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man sits among his broken experiments and looks at the burning
      Cathedral. Now the streets are swarming with people. They seek shelter and
      crowd into the cellars. They shout and call, and over all, slowly and
      without force, the rain drops into the city. Boom! And the steeple crashes
      down among the people. Boom! Boom, again! The water rushes along the
      gutters. The fire roars and mutters. Boom!

      Lead Soldiers
    </h2>
    <p>
      The nursery fire burns brightly, crackling in cheerful little explosions
      and trails of sparks up the back of the chimney. Miniature rockets
      peppering the black bricks with golden stars, as though a gala flamed a
      night of victorious wars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nodding mandarin on the bookcase moves his head forward and back,
      slowly, and looks into the air with his blue-green eyes. He stares into
      the air and nods&mdash;forward and back. The red rose in his hand is a
      crimson splash on his yellow coat. Forward and back, and his blue-green
      eyes stare into the air, and he nods&mdash;nods.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Tommy's soldiers march to battle,
    Trumpets flare and snare-drums rattle.
    Bayonets flash, and sabres glance&mdash;
    How the horses snort and prance!
    Cannon drawn up in a line
    Glitter in the dizzy shine
    Of the morning sunlight.  Flags
    Ripple colours in great jags.
    Red blows out, then blue, then green,
    Then all three&mdash;a weaving sheen
    Of prismed patriotism.  March
    Tommy's soldiers, stiff and starch,
    Boldly stepping to the rattle
    Of the drums, they go to battle.
</pre>
    <p>
      Tommy lies on his stomach on the floor and directs his columns. He puts
      his infantry in front, and before them ambles a mounted band. Their
      instruments make a strand of gold before the scarlet-tunicked soldiers,
      and they take very long steps on their little green platforms, and from
      the ranks bursts the song of Tommy's soldiers marching to battle. The song
      jolts a little as the green platforms stick on the thick carpet. Tommy
      wheels his guns round the edge of a box of blocks, and places a squad of
      cavalry on the commanding eminence of a footstool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire snaps pleasantly, and the old Chinaman nods&mdash;nods. The fire
      makes the red rose in his hand glow and twist. Hist! That is a bold song
      Tommy's soldiers sing as they march along to battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crack! Rattle! The sparks fly up the chimney.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Tommy's army's off to war&mdash;
    Not a soldier knows what for.
    But he knows about his rifle,
    How to shoot it, and a trifle
    Of the proper thing to do
    When it's he who is shot through.
    Like a cleverly trained flea,
    He can follow instantly
    Orders, and some quick commands
    Really make severe demands
    On a mind that's none too rapid,
    Leaden brains tend to the vapid.
    But how beautifully dressed
    Is this army!  How impressed
    Tommy is when at his heel
    All his baggage wagons wheel
    About the patterned carpet, and
    Moving up his heavy guns
    He sees them glow with diamond suns
    Flashing all along each barrel.
    And the gold and blue apparel
    Of his gunners is a joy.
    Tommy is a lucky boy.
        Boom!  Boom!  Ta-ra!
</pre>
    <p>
      The old mandarin nods under his purple umbrella. The rose in his hand
      shoots its petals up in thin quills of crimson. Then they collapse and
      shrivel like red embers. The fire sizzles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy is galloping his cavalry, two by two, over the floor. They must pass
      the open terror of the door and gain the enemy encamped under the
      wash-stand. The mounted band is very grand, playing allegro and leading
      the infantry on at the double quick. The tassel of the hearth-rug has
      flung down the bass-drum, and he and his dapple-grey horse lie
      overtripped, slipped out of line, with the little lead drumsticks
      glistening to the fire's shine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire burns and crackles, and tickles the tripped bass-drum with its
      sparkles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marching army hitches its little green platforms valiantly, and
      steadily approaches the door. The overturned bass-drummer, lying on the
      hearth-rug, melting in the heat, softens and sheds tears. The song jeers
      at his impotence, and flaunts the glory of the martial and still
      upstanding, vaunting the deeds it will do. For are not Tommy's soldiers
      all bright and new?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Tommy's leaden soldiers we,
    Glittering with efficiency.
    Not a button's out of place,
    Tons and tons of golden lace
    Wind about our officers.
    Every manly bosom stirs
    At the thought of killing&mdash;killing!
    Tommy's dearest wish fulfilling.
    We are gaudy, savage, strong,
    And our loins so ripe we long
    First to kill, then procreate,
    Doubling so the laws of Fate.
    On their women we have sworn
    To graft our sons.  And overborne
    They'll rear us younger soldiers, so
    Shall our race endure and grow,
    Waxing greater in the wombs
    Borrowed of them, while damp tombs
    Rot their men.  O Glorious War!
    Goad us with your points, Great Star!
</pre>
    <p>
      The china mandarin on the bookcase nods slowly, forward and back&mdash;forward
      and back&mdash;and the red rose writhes and wriggles, thrusting its
      flaming petals under and over one another like tortured snakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire strokes them with its dartles, and purrs at them, and the old man
      nods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy does not hear the song. He only sees the beautiful, new,
      gaily-coloured lead soldiers. They belong to him, and he is very proud and
      happy. He shouts his orders aloud, and gallops his cavalry past the door
      to the wash-stand. He creeps over the floor on his hands and knees to one
      battalion and another, but he sees only the bright colours of his soldiers
      and the beautiful precision of their gestures. He is a lucky boy to have
      such fine lead soldiers to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommy catches his toe in the leg of the wash-stand, and jars the pitcher.
      He snatches at it with his hands, but it is too late. The pitcher falls,
      and as it goes, he sees the white water flow over its lip. It slips
      between his fingers and crashes to the floor. But it is not water which
      oozes to the door. The stain is glutinous and dark, a spark from the
      firelight heads it to red. In and out, between the fine, new soldiers,
      licking over the carpet, squirms the stream of blood, lapping at the
      little green platforms, and flapping itself against the painted uniforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nodding mandarin moves his head slowly, forward and back. The rose is
      broken, and where it fell is black blood. The old mandarin leers under his
      purple umbrella, and nods&mdash;forward and back, staring into the air
      with blue-green eyes. Every time his head comes forward a rosebud pushes
      between his lips, rushes into full bloom, and drips to the ground with a
      splashing sound. The pool of black blood grows and grows, with each
      dropped rose, and spreads out to join the stream from the wash-stand. The
      beautiful army of lead soldiers steps boldly forward, but the little green
      platforms are covered in the rising stream of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nursery fire burns brightly and flings fan-bursts of stars up the
      chimney, as though a gala flamed a night of victorious wars.

      The Painter on Silk
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   There was a man
   Who made his living
   By painting roses
   Upon silk.

   He sat in an upper chamber
   And painted,
   And the noises of the street
   Meant nothing to him.

   When he heard bugles, and fifes, and drums,
   He thought of red, and yellow, and white roses
   Bursting in the sunshine,
   And smiled as he worked.

   He thought only of roses,
   And silk.
   When he could get no more silk
   He stopped painting
   And only thought
   Of roses.

   The day the conquerors
   Entered the city,
   The old man
   Lay dying.
   He heard the bugles and drums,
   And wished he could paint the roses
   Bursting into sound.

    <h2>
      A Ballad of Footmen
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Now what in the name of the sun and the stars
   Is the meaning of this most unholy of wars?

   Do men find life so full of humour and joy
   That for want of excitement they smash up the toy?

   Fifteen millions of soldiers with popguns and horses
   All bent upon killing, because their "of courses"

   Are not quite the same.  All these men by the ears,
   And nine nations of women choking with tears.

   It is folly to think that the will of a king
   Can force men to make ducks and drakes of a thing

   They value, and life is, at least one supposes,
   Of some little interest, even if roses

   Have not grown up between one foot and the other.
   What a marvel bureaucracy is, which can smother

   Such quite elementary feelings, and tag
   A man with a number, and set him to wag

   His legs and his arms at the word of command
   Or the blow of a whistle!  He's certainly damned,

   Fit only for mince-meat, if a little gold lace
   And an upturned moustache can set him to face

   Bullets, and bayonets, and death, and diseases,
   Because some one he calls his Emperor, pleases.

   If each man were to lay down his weapon, and say,
   With a click of his heels, "I wish you Good-day,"

   Now what, may I ask, could the Emperor do?
   A king and his minions are really so few.

   Angry?  Oh, of course, a most furious Emperor!
   But the men are so many they need not mind his temper, or

   The dire results which could not be inflicted.
   With no one to execute sentence, convicted

   Is just the weak wind from an old, broken bellows.
   What lackeys men are, who might be such fine fellows!

   To be killing each other, unmercifully,
   At an order, as though one said, "Bring up the tea."

   Or is it that tasting the blood on their jaws
   They lap at it, drunk with its ferment, and laws

   So patiently builded, are nothing to drinking
   More blood, any blood.  They don't notice its stinking.

   I don't suppose tigers do, fighting cocks, sparrows,
   And, as to men&mdash;what are men, when their marrows

   Are running with blood they have gulped; it is plain
   Such excellent sport does not recollect pain.

   Toll the bells in the steeples left standing.  Half-mast
   The flags which meant order, for order is past.

   Take the dust of the streets and sprinkle your head,
   The civilization we've worked for is dead.

   Squeeze into this archway, the head of the line
   Has just swung round the corner to 'Die Wacht am Rhein'.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
   You want to know what's the matter with me, do yer?
   My! ain't men blinder'n moles?
   It ain't nothin' new, be sure o' that.
   Why, ef you'd had eyes you'd ha' seed
   Me changin' under your very nose,
   Each day a little diff'rent.
   But you never see nothin', you don't.
   Don't touch me, Jake,
   Don't you dars't to touch me,
   I ain't in no humour.
   That's what's come over me;
   Jest a change clear through.
   You lay still, an' I'll tell yer,
   I've had it on my mind to tell yer
   Fer some time.
   It's a strain livin' a lie from mornin' till night,
   An' I'm goin' to put an end to it right now.
   An' don't make any mistake about one thing,
   When I married yer I loved yer.
   Why, your voice 'ud make
   Me go hot and cold all over,
   An' your kisses most stopped my heart from beatin'.
   Lord!  I was a silly fool.
   But that's the way 'twas.
   Well, I married yer
   An' thought Heav'n was comin'
   To set on the door-step.
   Heav'n didn't do no settin',
   Though the first year warn't so bad.
   The baby's fever threw you off some, I guess,
   An' then I took her death real hard,
   An' a mopey wife kind o' disgusts a man.
   I ain't blamin' yer exactly.
   But that's how 'twas.
   Do lay quiet,
   I know I'm slow, but it's harder to say 'n I thought.
   There come a time when I got to be
   More wife agin than mother.
   The mother part was sort of a waste
   When we didn't have no other child.
   But you'd got used ter lots o' things,
   An' you was all took up with the farm.
   Many's the time I've laid awake
   Watchin' the moon go clear through the elm-tree,
   Out o' sight.
   I'd foller yer around like a dog,
   An' set in the chair you'd be'n settin' in,
   Jest to feel its arms around me,
   So long's I didn't have yours.
   It preyed on me, I guess,
   Longin' and longin'
   While you was busy all day, and snorin' all night.
   Yes, I know you're wide awake now,
   But now ain't then,
   An' I guess you'll think diff'rent
   When I'm done.
   Do you mind the day you went to Hadrock?
   I didn't want to stay home for reasons,
   But you said someone 'd have to be here
   'Cause Elmer was comin' to see t' th' telephone.
   An' you never see why I was so set on goin' with yer,
   Our married life hadn't be'n any great shakes,
   Still marriage is marriage, an' I was raised God-fearin'.
   But, Lord, you didn't notice nothin',
   An' Elmer hangin' around all Winter!
   'Twas a lovely mornin'.
   The apple-trees was jest elegant
   With their blossoms all flared out,
   An' there warn't a cloud in the sky.
   You went, you wouldn't pay no 'tention to what I said,
   An' I heard the Ford chuggin' for most a mile,
   The air was so still.
   Then Elmer come.
   It's no use your frettin', Jake,
   I'll tell you all about it.
   I know what I'm doin',
   An' what's worse, I know what I done.
   Elmer fixed th' telephone in about two minits,
   An' he didn't seem in no hurry to go,
   An' I don't know as I wanted him to go either,
   I was awful mad at your not takin' me with yer,
   An' I was tired o' wishin' and wishin'
   An' gittin' no comfort.
   I guess it ain't necessary to tell yer all the things.
   He stayed to dinner,
   An' he helped me do the dishes,
   An' he said a home was a fine thing,
   An' I said dishes warn't a home
   Nor yet the room they're in.
   He said a lot o' things,
   An' I fended him off at first,
   But he got talkin' all around me,
   Clost up to the things I'd be'n thinkin',
   What's the use o' me goin' on, Jake,
   You know.
   He got all he wanted,
   An' I give it to him,
   An' what's more, I'm glad!
   I ain't dead, anyway,
   An' somebody thinks I'm somethin'.
   Keep away, Jake,
   You can kill me to-morrer if you want to,
   But I'm goin' to have my say.
   Funny thing!  Guess I ain't made to hold a man.
   Elmer ain't be'n here for mor'n two months.
   I don't want to pretend nothin',
   Mebbe if he'd be'n lately
   I shouldn't have told yer.
   I'll go away in the mornin', o' course.
   What you want the light fer?
   I don't look no diff'rent.
   Ain't the moon bright enough
   To look at a woman that's deceived yer by?
   Don't, Jake, don't, you can't love me now!
   It ain't a question of forgiveness.
   Why!  I'd be thinkin' o' Elmer ev'ry minute;
   It ain't decent.
   Oh, my God!  It ain't decent any more either way!

   I never figured he'd be close with you."
   "Oh, he ain't.  Not close.
   That ain't why.
   But I must git away from here.
   I must!  I must!"
   "You got a lot o' reason in yer
   To-night.
   How long d' you cal'late
   You'll be gone?"
   "Maybe for always."
   "What ails yer, Alice?
   Talkin' wild like that.
   Ain't you an' me goin' to be married
   Some day."
   "Some day!  Some day!
   I guess the sun'll never rise on some day."
   "So that's the trouble.
   Same old story.
   'Cause I ain't got the cash to settle right now.
   You know I love yer,
   An' I'll marry yer as soon
   As I c'n raise the money."
   "You've said that any time these five year,
   But you don't do nothin'."
   "Wot could I do?
   Ther ain't no work here Winters.
   Not fer a carpenter, ther ain't."
   "I guess you warn't born a carpenter.
   Ther's ice-cuttin' a plenty."
   "I got a dret'ful tender throat;
   Dr. Smiles he told me
   I mustn't resk ice-cuttin'."
   "Why haven't you gone to Boston,
   And hunted up a job?"
   "Have yer forgot the time I went expressin'
   In the American office, down ther?"
   "And come back two weeks later!
   No, I ain't."
   "You didn't want I should git hurted,
   Did yer?
   I'm a sight too light fer all that liftin' work.
   My back was commencin' to strain, as 'twas.
   Ef I was like yer brother now,
   I'd ha' be'n down to the city long ago.
   But I'm too clumsy fer a dancer.
   I ain't got Arthur's luck."
   "Do you call it luck to be a disgrace to your folks,
   And git locked up in jail!"
   "Oh, come now, Alice,
   'Disgrace' is a mite strong.
   Why, the jail was a joke.
   Art's all right."
   "All right!
   All right to dance, and smirk, and lie
   For a livin',
   And then in the end
   Lead a silly girl to give you
   What warn't hers to give
   By pretendin' you'd marry her&mdash;
   And she a pupil."
   "He'd ha' married her right enough,
   Her folks was millionaires."
   "Yes, he'd ha' married her!
   Thank God, they saved her that."
   "Art's a fine feller.
   I wish I had his luck.
   Swellin' round in Hart, Schaffner &amp; Marx fancy suits,
   And eatin' in rest'rants.
   But somebody's got to stick to the old place,
   Else Foxfield'd have to shut up shop,
   Hey, Alice?"
   "You admire him!
   You admire Arthur!
   You'd be like him only you can't dance.
   Oh, Shame!  Shame!
   And I've been like that silly girl.
   Fooled with your promises,
   And I give you all I had.
   I knew it, oh, I knew it,
   But I wanted to git away 'fore I proved it.
   You've shamed me through and through.
   Why couldn't you hold your tongue,
   And spared me seein' you
   As you really are."
   "What the Devil's the row?
   I only said Art was lucky.
   What you spitfirin' at me fer?
   Ferget it, Alice.
   We've had good times, ain't we?
   I'll see Cleve 'bout that job agin to-morrer,
   And we'll be married 'fore hayin' time."
   "It's like you to remind me o' hayin' time.
   I've good cause to love it, ain't I?
   Many's the night I've hid my face in the dark
   To shut out thinkin'!"
   "Why, that ain't nothin'.
   You ain't be'n half so kind to me
   As lots o' fellers' girls.
   Gi' me a kiss, Dear,
   And let's make up."
   "Make up!
   You poor fool.
   Do you suppose I care a ten cent piece
   For you now.
   You've killed yourself for me.
   Done it out o' your own mouth.
   You've took away my home,
   I hate the sight o' the place.
   You're all over it,
   Every stick an' stone means you,
   An' I hate 'em all."
   "Alice, I say,
   Don't go on like that.
   I can't marry yer
   Boardin' in one room,
   But I'll see Cleve to-morrer,
   I'll make him&mdash;&mdash;"
   "Oh, you fool!
   You terrible fool!"
   "Alice, don't go yit,
   Wait a minit,
   I'll see Cleve&mdash;&mdash;"
   "You terrible fool!"
   "Alice, don't go.
   Alice&mdash;&mdash;"  (Door slams)
