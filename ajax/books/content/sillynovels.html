    <h1>Silly Novels by Lady Novelists</h1>
    <h2>Mary Anne Evans</h2>
  </section>

  <p>Silly Novels by Lady Novelists are a genus with many species,
determined by the particular quality of silliness that
predominates in them&mdash;the frothy, the prosy, the pious, or
the pedantic.&nbsp; But it is a mixture of all these&mdash;a
composite order of feminine fatuity&mdash;that produces the
largest class of such novels, which we shall distinguish as the
<i>mind-and-millinery</i> species.&nbsp; The heroine is usually
an heiress, probably a peeress in her own right, with perhaps a
vicious baronet, an amiable duke, and an irresistible younger son
of a marquis as lovers in the foreground, a clergyman and a poet
sighing for her in the middle distance, and a crowd of undefined
adorers dimly indicated beyond.&nbsp; Her eyes and her wit are
both dazzling; her nose and her morals are alike free from any
tendency to irregularity; she has a superb <i>contralto</i> and a
superb intellect; she is perfectly well dressed and perfectly
religious; she dances like a sylph, and reads the Bible in the
original tongues.&nbsp; Or it may be that the heroine is not an
heiress&mdash;that rank and wealth are the only things in which
she is deficient; but she infallibly gets into high society, she
has the triumph of refusing many matches and securing the best,
and she wears some family jewels or other as a sort of crown of
righteousness at the end.&nbsp; Rakish men either bite their lips
in impotent confusion at her repartees, or are touched to
penitence by her reproofs, which, on appropriate occasions, rise
to a lofty strain of rhetoric; indeed, there is a general
propensity in her to make speeches, and to rhapsodize at some
length when she retires to her bedroom.&nbsp; In her recorded
conversations she is amazingly <!-- page 179--><a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>eloquent,
and in her unrecorded conversations amazingly witty.&nbsp; She is
understood to have a depth of insight that looks through and
through the shallow theories of philosophers, and her superior
instincts are a sort of dial by which men have only to set their
clocks and watches, and all will go well.&nbsp; The men play a
very subordinate part by her side.&nbsp; You are consoled now and
then by a hint that they have affairs, which keeps you in mind
that the working-day business of the world is somehow being
carried on, but ostensibly the final cause of their existence is
that they may accompany the heroine on her &ldquo;starring&rdquo;
expedition through life.&nbsp; They see her at a ball, and they
are dazzled; at a flower-show, and they are fascinated; on a
riding excursion, and they are witched by her noble horsemanship;
at church, and they are awed by the sweet solemnity of her
demeanor.&nbsp; She is the ideal woman in feelings, faculties,
and flounces.&nbsp; For all this she as often as not marries the
wrong person to begin with, and she suffers terribly from the
plots and intrigues of the vicious baronet; but even death has a
soft place in his heart for such a paragon, and remedies all
mistakes for her just at the right moment.&nbsp; The vicious
baronet is sure to be killed in a duel, and the tedious husband
dies in his bed requesting his wife, as a particular favor to
him, to marry the man she loves best, and having already
dispatched a note to the lover informing him of the comfortable
arrangement.&nbsp; Before matters arrive at this desirable issue
our feelings are tried by seeing the noble, lovely, and gifted
heroine pass through many <i>mauvais moments</i>, but we have the
satisfaction of knowing that her sorrows are wept into
embroidered pocket-handkerchiefs, that her fainting form reclines
on the very best upholstery, and that whatever vicissitudes she
may undergo, from being dashed out of her carriage to having her
head shaved in a fever, she comes out of them all with a
complexion more blooming and locks more redundant than ever.</p>
<p>We may remark, by the way, that we have been relieved from a
serious scruple by discovering that silly novels by lady <!--
page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>novelists rarely introduce us into any other than very
lofty and fashionable society.&nbsp; We had imagined that
destitute women turned novelists, as they turned governesses,
because they had no other &ldquo;ladylike&rdquo; means of getting
their bread.&nbsp; On this supposition, vacillating syntax, and
improbable incident had a certain pathos for us, like the
extremely supererogatory pincushions and ill-devised nightcaps
that are offered for sale by a blind man.&nbsp; We felt the
commodity to be a nuisance, but we were glad to think that the
money went to relieve the necessitous, and we pictured to
ourselves lonely women struggling for a maintenance, or wives and
daughters devoting themselves to the production of
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; out of pure heroism&mdash;perhaps to pay their
husband&rsquo;s debts or to purchase luxuries for a sick
father.&nbsp; Under these impressions we shrank from criticising
a lady&rsquo;s novel: her English might be faulty, but we said to
ourselves her motives are irreproachable; her imagination may be
uninventive, but her patience is untiring.&nbsp; Empty writing
was excused by an empty stomach, and twaddle was consecrated by
tears.&nbsp; But no!&nbsp; This theory of ours, like many other
pretty theories, has had to give way before observation.&nbsp;
Women&rsquo;s silly novels, we are now convinced, are written
under totally different circumstances.&nbsp; The fair writers
have evidently never talked to a tradesman except from a carriage
window; they have no notion of the working-classes except as
&ldquo;dependents;&rdquo; they think five hundred a year a
miserable pittance; Belgravia and &ldquo;baronial halls&rdquo;
are their primary truths; and they have no idea of feeling
interest in any man who is not at least a great landed
proprietor, if not a prime minister.&nbsp; It is clear that they
write in elegant boudoirs, with violet-colored ink and a ruby
pen; that they must be entirely indifferent to publishers&rsquo;
accounts, and inexperienced in every form of poverty except
poverty of brains.&nbsp; It is true that we are constantly struck
with the want of verisimilitude in their representations of the
high society in which they seem to live; but then they betray no
closer acquaintance with any other form of life.&nbsp; If their
peers and peeresses are improbable, their <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>literary
men, tradespeople, and cottagers are impossible; and their
intellect seems to have the peculiar impartiality of reproducing
both what they <i>have</i> seen and heard, and what they have
<i>not</i> seen and heard, with equal unfaithfulness.</p>
<p>There are few women, we suppose, who have not seen something
of children under five years of age, yet in
&ldquo;Compensation,&rdquo; a recent novel of the
mind-and-millinery species, which calls itself a &ldquo;story of
real life,&rdquo; we have a child of four and a half years old
talking in this Ossianic fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I am so happy, dear grand
mamma;&mdash;I have seen&mdash;I have seen such a delightful
person; he is like everything beautiful&mdash;like the smell of
sweet flowers, and the view from Ben Lemond;&mdash;or no,
<i>better than that</i>&mdash;he is like what I think of and see
when I am very, very happy; and he is really like mamma, too,
when she sings; and his forehead is like <i>that distant
sea</i>,&rsquo; she continued, pointing to the blue
Mediterranean; &lsquo;there seems no end&mdash;no end; or like
the clusters of stars I like best to look at on a warm fine
night. . . . Don&rsquo;t look so . . . your forehead is like Loch
Lomond, when the wind is blowing and the sun is gone in; I like
the sunshine best when the lake is smooth. . . . So now&mdash;I
like it better than ever . . . It is more beautiful still from
the dark cloud that has gone over it, <i>when the sun suddenly
lights up all the colors of the forests and shining purple
rocks</i>, <i>and it is all reflected in the waters
below</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not surprised to learn that the mother of this infant
phenomenon, who exhibits symptoms so alarmingly like those of
adolescence repressed by gin, is herself a ph&oelig;nix.&nbsp; We
are assured, again and again, that she had a remarkably original
in mind, that she was a genius, and &ldquo;conscious of her
originality,&rdquo; and she was fortunate enough to have a lover
who was also a genius and a man of &ldquo;most original
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This lover, we read, though &ldquo;wonderfully similar&rdquo;
to her &ldquo;in powers and capacity,&rdquo; was
&ldquo;infinitely superior to her in faith and
development,&rdquo; and she saw in him
&ldquo;&lsquo;Agape&rsquo;&mdash;so rare to find&mdash;of which
she had read and admired the meaning in her Greek Testament;
having, <i>from her great facility in learning languages</i>,
read the Scriptures in their original
<i>tongues</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; Greek and Hebrew
are mere play to <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>a heroine; Sanscrit is no more than
<i>a</i> <i>b</i> <i>c</i> to her; and she can talk with perfect
correctness in any language, except English.&nbsp; She is a
polking polyglot, a Creuzer in crinoline.&nbsp; Poor men.&nbsp;
There are so few of you who know even Hebrew; you think it
something to boast of if, like Bolingbroke, you only
&ldquo;understand that sort of learning and what is writ about
it;&rdquo; and you are perhaps adoring women who can think
slightingly of you in all the Semitic languages
successively.&nbsp; But, then, as we are almost invariably told
that a heroine has a &ldquo;beautifully small head,&rdquo; and as
her intellect has probably been early invigorated by an attention
to costume and deportment, we may conclude that she can pick up
the Oriental tongues, to say nothing of their dialects, with the
same a&euml;rial facility that the butterfly sips nectar.&nbsp;
Besides, there can be no difficulty in conceiving the depth of
the heroine&rsquo;s erudition when that of the authoress is so
evident.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Laura Gay,&rdquo; another novel of the same school,
the heroine seems less at home in Greek and Hebrew but she makes
up for the deficiency by a quite playful familiarity with the
Latin classics&mdash;with the &ldquo;dear old Virgil,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the graceful Horace, the humane Cicero, and the pleasant
Livy;&rdquo; indeed, it is such a matter of course with her to
quote Latin that she does it at a picnic in a very mixed company
of ladies and gentlemen, having, we are told, &ldquo;no
conception that the nobler sex were capable of jealousy on this
subject.&nbsp; And if, indeed,&rdquo; continues the biographer of
Laura Gray, &ldquo;the wisest and noblest portion of that sex
were in the majority, no such sentiment would exist; but while
Miss Wyndhams and Mr. Redfords abound, great sacrifices must be
made to their existence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such sacrifices, we
presume, as abstaining from Latin quotations, of extremely
moderate interest and applicability, which the wise and noble
minority of the other sex would be quite as willing to dispense
with as the foolish and ignoble majority.&nbsp; It is as little
the custom of well-bred men as of well-bred women to quote Latin
in mixed parties; they can contain their familiarity with
&ldquo;the humane Cicero&rdquo; without allowing it <!-- page
183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>to
boil over in ordinary conversation, and even references to
&ldquo;the pleasant Livy&rdquo; are not absolutely
irrepressible.&nbsp; But Ciceronian Latin is the mildest form of
Miss Gay&rsquo;s conversational power.&nbsp; Being on the
Palatine with a party of sight-seers, she falls into the
following vein of well-rounded remark: &ldquo;Truth can only be
pure objectively, for even in the creeds where it predominates,
being subjective, and parcelled out into portions, each of these
necessarily receives a hue of idiosyncrasy, that is, a taint of
superstition more or less strong; while in such creeds as the
Roman Catholic, ignorance, interest, the basis of ancient
idolatries, and the force of authority, have gradually
accumulated on the pure truth, and transformed it, at last, into
a mass of superstition for the majority of its votaries; and how
few are there, alas! whose zeal, courage, and intellectual energy
are equal to the analysis of this accumulation, and to the
discovery of the pearl of great price which lies hidden beneath
this heap of rubbish.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have often met with women
much more novel and profound in their observations than Laura
Gay, but rarely with any so inopportunely long-winded.&nbsp; A
clerical lord, who is half in love with her, is alarmed by the
daring remarks just quoted, and begins to suspect that she is
inclined to free-thinking.&nbsp; But he is mistaken; when in a
moment of sorrow he delicately begs leave to &ldquo;recall to her
memory, a <i>dep&ocirc;t</i> of strength and consolation under
affliction, which, until we are hard pressed by the trials of
life, we are too apt to forget,&rdquo; we learn that she really
has &ldquo;recurrence to that sacred dep&ocirc;t,&rdquo; together
with the tea-pot.&nbsp; There is a certain flavor of orthodoxy
mixed with the parade of fortunes and fine carriages in
&ldquo;Laura Gay,&rdquo; but it is an orthodoxy mitigated by
study of &ldquo;the humane Cicero,&rdquo; and by an
&ldquo;intellectual disposition to analyze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compensation&rdquo; is much more heavily dosed with
doctrine, but then it has a treble amount of snobbish worldliness
and absurd incident to tickle the palate of pious
frivolity.&nbsp; Linda, the heroine, is still more speculative
and spiritual than Laura Gay, but she has been
&ldquo;presented,&rdquo; and has more and far <!-- page 184--><a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>grander
lovers; very wicked and fascinating women are
introduced&mdash;even a French <i>lionne</i>; and no expense is
spared to get up as exciting a story as you will find in the most
immoral novels.&nbsp; In fact, it is a wonderful <i>pot
pourri</i> of Almack&rsquo;s, Scotch second-sight, Mr.
Rogers&rsquo;s breakfasts, Italian brigands, death-bed
conversions, superior authoresses, Italian mistresses, and
attempts at poisoning old ladies, the whole served up with a
garnish of talk about &ldquo;faith and development&rdquo; and
&ldquo;most original minds.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even Miss Susan Barton,
the superior authoress, whose pen moves in a &ldquo;quick,
decided manner when she is composing,&rdquo; declines the finest
opportunities of marriage; and though old enough to be
Linda&rsquo;s mother (since we are told that she refused
Linda&rsquo;s father), has her hand sought by a young earl, the
heroine&rsquo;s rejected lover.&nbsp; Of course, genius and
morality must be backed by eligible offers, or they would seem
rather a dull affair; and piety, like other things, in order to
be <i>comme il faut</i>, must be in &ldquo;society,&rdquo; and
have admittance to the best circles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rank and Beauty&rdquo; is a more frothy and less
religious variety of the mind-and-millinery species.&nbsp; The
heroine, we are told, &ldquo;if she inherited her father&rsquo;s
pride of birth and her mother&rsquo;s beauty of person, had in
herself a tone of enthusiastic feeling that, perhaps, belongs to
her age even in the lowly born, but which is refined into the
high spirit of wild romance only in the far descended, who feel
that it is their best inheritance.&rdquo;&nbsp; This enthusiastic
young lady, by dint of reading the newspaper to her father, falls
in love with the <i>prime minister</i>, who, through the medium
of leading articles and &ldquo;the <i>resum&eacute;</i> of the
debates,&rdquo; shines upon her imagination as a bright
particular star, which has no parallax for her living in the
country as simple Miss Wyndham.&nbsp; But she forthwith becomes
Baroness Umfraville in her own right, astonishes the world with
her beauty and accomplishments when she bursts upon it from her
mansion in Spring Gardens, and, as you foresee, will presently
come into contact with the unseen <i>objet aim&eacute;</i>.&nbsp;
Perhaps the words &ldquo;prime minister&rdquo; suggest to you a
wrinkled or <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>obese sexagenarian; but pray dismiss
the image.&nbsp; Lord Rupert Conway has been &ldquo;called while
still almost a youth to the first situation which a subject can
hold in the <i>universe</i>,&rdquo; and even leading articles and
a <i>resum&eacute;</i> of the debates have not conjured up a
dream that surpasses the fact.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The door opened again, and Lord Rupert
Conway entered.&nbsp; Evelyn gave one glance.&nbsp; It was
enough; she was not disappointed.&nbsp; It seemed as if a picture
on which she had long gazed was suddenly instinct with life, and
had stepped from its frame before her.&nbsp; His tall figure, the
distinguished simplicity of his air&mdash;it was a living
Vandyke, a cavalier, one of his noble cavalier ancestors, or one
to whom her fancy had always likened him, who long of yore had
with an Umfraville fought the Paynim far beyond the sea.&nbsp;
Was this reality?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very little like it, certainly.</p>
<p>By and by it becomes evident that the ministerial heart is
touched.&nbsp; Lady Umfraville is on a visit to the Queen at
Windsor, and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The last evening of her stay, when they
returned from riding, Mr. Wyndham took her and a large party to
the top of the Keep, to see the view.&nbsp; She was leaning on
the battlements, gazing from that &lsquo;stately height&rsquo; at
the prospect beneath her, when Lord Rupert was by her side.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What an unrivalled view!&rsquo; exclaimed she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, it would have been wrong to go without
having been up here.&nbsp; You are pleased with your
visit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Enchanted!&nbsp; A Queen to live and die under,
to live and die for!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ha!&rsquo; cried he, with sudden emotion, and
with a <i>eureka</i> expression of countenance, as if he had
<i>indeed found a heart in unison with his own</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;<i>eureka</i> expression of countenance&rdquo; you
see at once to be prophetic of marriage at the end of the third
volume; but before that desirable consummation there are very
complicated misunderstandings, arising chiefly from the
vindictive plotting of Sir Luttrel Wycherley, who is a genius, a
poet, and in every way a most remarkable character indeed.&nbsp;
He is not only a romantic poet, but a hardened rake and a cynical
wit; yet <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>his deep passion for Lady Umfraville
has so impoverished his epigrammatic talent that he cuts an
extremely poor figure in conversation.&nbsp; When she rejects
him, he rushes into the shrubbery and rolls himself in the dirt;
and on recovering, devotes himself to the most diabolical and
laborious schemes of vengeance, in the course of which he
disguises himself as a quack physician and enters into general
practice, foreseeing that Evelyn will fall ill, and that he shall
be called in to attend her.&nbsp; At last, when all his schemes
are frustrated, he takes leave of her in a long letter, written,
as you will perceive from the following passage, entirely in the
style of an eminent literary man:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, lady, nursed in pomp and pleasure, will
you ever cast one thought upon the miserable being who addresses
you?&nbsp; Will you ever, as your gilded galley is floating down
the unruffled stream of prosperity, will you ever, while lulled
by the sweetest music&mdash;thine own praises&mdash;hear the
far-off sigh from that world to which I am going?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the whole, however, frothy as it is, we rather prefer
&ldquo;Rank and Beauty&rdquo; to the two other novels we have
mentioned.&nbsp; The dialogue is more natural and spirited; there
is some frank ignorance and no pedantry; and you are allowed to
take the heroine&rsquo;s astounding intellect upon trust, without
being called on to read her conversational refutations of
sceptics and philosophers, or her rhetorical solutions of the
mysteries of the universe.</p>
<p>Writers of the mind-and-millinery school are remarkably
unanimous in their choice of diction.&nbsp; In their novels there
is usually a lady or gentleman who is more or less of a upas
tree; the lover has a manly breast; minds are redolent of various
things; hearts are hollow; events are utilized; friends are
consigned to the tomb; infancy is an engaging period; the sun is
a luminary that goes to his western couch, or gathers the
rain-drops into his refulgent bosom; life is a melancholy boon;
Albion and Scotia are conversational epithets.&nbsp; There is a
striking resemblance, too, in the character of their moral
comments, such, for instance, as that &ldquo;It is a fact, no
less true <!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>than melancholy, that all people,
more or less, richer or poorer, are swayed by bad example;&rdquo;
that &ldquo;Books, however trivial, contain some subjects from
which useful information may be drawn;&rdquo; that &ldquo;Vice
can too often borrow the language of virtue;&rdquo; that
&ldquo;Merit and nobility of nature must exist, to be accepted,
for clamor and pretension cannot impose upon those too well read
in human nature to be easily deceived;&rdquo; and that &ldquo;In
order to forgive, we must have been injured.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
is doubtless a class of readers to whom these remarks appear
peculiarly pointed and pungent; for we often find them doubly and
trebly scored with the pencil, and delicate hands giving in their
determined adhesion to these hardy novelties by a distinct
<i>tr&egrave;s vrai</i>, emphasized by many notes of
exclamation.&nbsp; The colloquial style of these novels is often
marked by much ingenious inversion, and a careful avoidance of
such cheap phraseology as can be heard every day.&nbsp; Angry
young gentlemen exclaim, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis ever thus,
methinks;&rdquo; and in the half hour before dinner a young lady
informs her next neighbor that the first day she read Shakespeare
she &ldquo;stole away into the park, and beneath the shadow of
the greenwood tree, devoured with rapture the inspired page of
the great magician.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the most remarkable efforts
of the mind-and-millinery writers lie in their philosophic
reflections.&nbsp; The authoress of &ldquo;Laura Gay,&rdquo; for
example, having married her hero and heroine, improves the event
by observing that &ldquo;if those sceptics, whose eyes have so
long gazed on matter that they can no longer see aught else in
man, could once enter with heart and soul, into such bliss as
this, they would come to say that the soul of man and the polypus
are not of common origin, or of the same texture.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lady novelists, it appears, can see something else besides
matter; they are not limited to phenomena, but can relieve their
eyesight by occasional glimpses of the <i>noumenon</i>, and are,
therefore, naturally better able than any one else to confound
sceptics, even of that remarkable but to us unknown school which
maintains that the soul of man is of the same texture as the
polypus.</p>
<p><!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>The most pitiable of all silly novels by lady novelists
are what we may call the <i>oracular</i> species&mdash;novels
intended to expound the writer&rsquo;s religious, philosophical,
or moral theories.&nbsp; There seems to be a notion abroad among
women, rather akin to the superstition that the speech and
actions of idiots are inspired, and that the human being most
entirely exhausted of common-sense is the fittest vehicle of
revelation.&nbsp; To judge from their writings, there are certain
ladies who think that an amazing ignorance, both of science and
of life, is the best possible qualification for forming an
opinion on the knottiest moral and speculative questions.&nbsp;
Apparently, their recipe for solving all such difficulties is
something like this: Take a woman&rsquo;s head, stuff it with a
smattering of philosophy and literature chopped small, and with
false notions of society baked hard, let it hang over a desk a
few hours every day, and serve up hot in feeble English when not
required.&nbsp; You will rarely meet with a lady novelist of the
oracular class who is diffident of her ability to decide on
theological questions&mdash;who has any suspicion that she is not
capable of discriminating with the nicest accuracy between the
good and evil in all church parties&mdash;who does not see
precisely how it is that men have gone wrong hitherto&mdash;and
pity philosophers in general that they have not had the
opportunity of consulting her.&nbsp; Great writers, who have
modestly contented themselves with putting their experience into
fiction, and have thought it quite a sufficient task to exhibit
men and things as they are, she sighs over as deplorably
deficient in the application of their powers.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
have solved no great questions&rdquo;&mdash;and she is ready to
remedy their omission by setting before you a complete theory of
life and manual of divinity in a love story, where ladies and
gentlemen of good family go through genteel vicissitudes, to the
utter confusion of Deists, Puseyites, and ultra-Protestants, and
to the perfect establishment of that peculiar view of
Christianity which either condenses itself into a sentence of
small caps, or explodes into a cluster of stars on the three
hundred and thirtieth page.&nbsp; It is true, the ladies and <!--
page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>gentlemen will probably seem to you remarkably little
like any you have had the fortune or misfortune to meet with,
for, as a general rule, the ability of a lady novelist to
describe actual life and her fellow-men is in inverse proportion
to her confident eloquence about God and the other world, and the
means by which she usually chooses to conduct you to true ideas
of the invisible is a totally false picture of the visible.</p>
<p>As typical a novel of the oracular kind as we can hope to meet
with, is &ldquo;The Enigma: a Leaf from the Chronicles of the
Wolchorley House.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;enigma&rdquo; which
this novel is to solve is certainly one that demands powers no
less gigantic than those of a lady novelist, being neither more
nor less than the existence of evil.&nbsp; The problem is stated
and the answer dimly foreshadowed on the very first page.&nbsp;
The spirited young lady, with raven hair, says, &ldquo;All life
is an inextricable confusion;&rdquo; and the meek young lady,
with auburn hair, looks at the picture of the Madonna which she
is copying, and&mdash;&ldquo;<i>There</i> seemed the solution of
that mighty enigma.&rdquo;&nbsp; The style of this novel is quite
as lofty as its purpose; indeed, some passages on which we have
spent much patient study are quite beyond our reach, in spite of
the illustrative aid of italics and small caps; and we must await
further &ldquo;development&rdquo; in order to understand
them.&nbsp; Of Ernest, the model young clergyman, who sets every
one right on all occasions, we read that &ldquo;he held not of
marriage in the marketable kind, after a social
desecration;&rdquo; that, on one eventful night, &ldquo;sleep had
not visited his divided heart, where tumultuated, in varied type
and combination, the aggregate feelings of grief and joy;&rdquo;
and that, &ldquo;for the <i>marketable</i> human article he had
no toleration, be it of what sort, or set for what value it
might, whether for worship or class, his upright soul abhorred
it, whose ultimatum, the self-deceiver, was to him <span
class="smcap">the</span> <i>great spiritual lie</i>,
&lsquo;living in a vain show, deceiving and being
deceived;&rsquo; since he did not suppose the phylactery and
enlarged border on the garment to be <i>merely</i> a social
trick.&rdquo;&nbsp; (The italics and small caps are the
author&rsquo;s, and we hope they assist the reader&rsquo;s <!--
page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>comprehension.)&nbsp; Of Sir Lionel, the model old
gentleman, we are told that &ldquo;the simple ideal of the middle
age, apart from its anarchy and decadence, in him most truly
seemed to live again, when the ties which knit men together were
of heroic cast.&nbsp; The first-born colors of pristine faith and
truth engraven on the common soul of man, and blent into the wide
arch of brotherhood, where the prim&aelig;val law of <i>order</i>
grew and multiplied each perfect after his kind, and mutually
interdependent.&rdquo;&nbsp; You see clearly, of course, how
colors are first engraven on the soul, and then blent into a wide
arch, on which arch of colors&mdash;apparently a
rainbow&mdash;the law of order grew and multiplied,
each&mdash;apparently the arch and the law&mdash;perfect after
his kind?&nbsp; If, after this, you can possibly want any further
aid toward knowing what Sir Lionel was, we can tell you that in
his soul &ldquo;the scientific combinations of thought could
educe no fuller harmonies of the good and the true than lay in
the prim&aelig;val pulses which floated as an atmosphere around
it!&rdquo; and that, when he was sealing a letter, &ldquo;Lo! the
responsive throb in that good man&rsquo;s bosom echoed back in
simple truth the honest witness of a heart that condemned him
not, as his eye, bedewed with love, rested, too, with something
of ancestral pride, on the undimmed motto of the
family&mdash;&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Loiaute</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slightest matters have their vulgarity fumigated out of
them by the same elevated style.&nbsp; Commonplace people would
say that a copy of Shakespeare lay on a drawing-room table; but
the authoress of &ldquo;The Enigma,&rdquo; bent on edifying
periphrasis, tells you that there lay on the table, &ldquo;that
fund of human thought and feeling, which teaches the heart
through the little name, &lsquo;Shakespeare.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
A watchman sees a light burning in an upper window rather longer
than usual, and thinks that people are foolish to sit up late
when they have an opportunity of going to bed; but, lest this
fact should seem too low and common, it is presented to us in the
following striking and metaphysical manner: &ldquo;He
marvelled&mdash;as a man <i>will</i> think for others in a
necessarily separate personality, <!-- page 191--><a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>consequently (though disallowing it) in false mental
premise&mdash;how differently <i>he</i> should act, how gladly
<i>he</i> should prize the rest so lightly held of
within.&rdquo;&nbsp; A footman&mdash;an ordinary Jeames, with
large calves and aspirated vowels&mdash;answers the door-bell,
and the opportunity is seized to tell you that he was a
&ldquo;type of the large class of pampered menials, who follow
the curse of Cain&mdash;&lsquo;vagabonds&rsquo; on the face of
the earth, and whose estimate of the human class varies in the
graduated scale of money and expenditure. . . . These, and such
as these, O England, be the false lights of thy morbid
civilization!&rdquo;&nbsp; We have heard of various &ldquo;false
lights,&rdquo; from Dr. Cumming to Robert Owen, from Dr. Pusey to
the Spirit-rappers, but we never before heard of the false light
that emanates from plush and powder.</p>
<p>In the same way very ordinary events of civilized life are
exalted into the most awful crises, and ladies in full skirts and
<i>manches &agrave; la Chinoise</i>, conduct themselves not
unlike the heroines of sanguinary melodramas.&nbsp; Mrs. Percy, a
shallow woman of the world, wishes her son Horace to marry the
auburn-haired Grace, she being an heiress; but he, after the
manner of sons, falls in love with the raven-haired Kate, the
heiress&rsquo;s portionless cousin; and, moreover, Grace herself
shows every symptom of perfect indifference to Horace.&nbsp; In
such cases sons are often sulky or fiery, mothers are alternately
man&oelig;uvring and waspish, and the portionless young lady
often lies awake at night and cries a good deal.&nbsp; We are
getting used to these things now, just as we are used to eclipses
of the moon, which no longer set us howling and beating tin
kettles.&nbsp; We never heard of a lady in a fashionable
&ldquo;front&rdquo; behaving like Mrs. Percy under these
circumstances.&nbsp; Happening one day to see Horace talking to
Grace at a window, without in the least knowing what they are
talking about, or having the least reason to believe that Grace,
who is mistress of the house and a person of dignity, would
accept her son if he were to offer himself, she suddenly rushes
up to them and clasps them both, saying, &ldquo;with a flushed
countenance and in <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>an excited
manner&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This is indeed happiness; for, may I
not call you so, Grace?&mdash;my Grace&mdash;my Horace&rsquo;s
Grace!&mdash;my dear children!&rdquo;&nbsp; Her son tells her she
is mistaken, and that he is engaged to Kate, whereupon we have
the following scene and tableau:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gathering herself up to an unprecedented
height (!) her eyes lightening forth the fire of her anger:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wretched boy!&rsquo; she said, hoarsely and
scornfully, and clenching her hand, &lsquo;Take then the doom of
your own choice!&nbsp; Bow down your miserable head and let a
mother&rsquo;s&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Curse not!&rsquo; spake a deep low voice from
behind, and Mrs. Percy started, scared, as though she had seen a
heavenly visitant appear, to break upon her in the midst of her
sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meantime Horace had fallen on his knees, at her feet,
and hid his face in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who then, is she&mdash;who!&nbsp; Truly his
&lsquo;guardian spirit&rsquo; hath stepped between him and the
fearful words, which, however unmerited, must have hung as a pall
over his future existence;&mdash;a spell which could not be
unbound&mdash;which could not be unsaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of an earthly paleness, but calm with the still,
iron-bound calmness of death&mdash;the only calm one
there&mdash;Katherine stood; and her words smote on the ear in
tones whose appallingly slow and separate intonation rung on the
heart like a chill, isolated tolling of some fatal knell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He would have plighted me his faith, but I did
not accept it; you cannot, therefore&mdash;you <i>dare</i> not
curse him.&nbsp; And here,&rsquo; she continued, raising her hand
to heaven, whither her large dark eyes also rose with a chastened
glow, which, for the first time, <i>suffering</i> had lighted in
those passionate orbs&mdash;&lsquo;here I promise, come weal,
come woe, that Horace Wolchorley and I do never interchange vows
without his mother&rsquo;s sanction&mdash;without his
mother&rsquo;s blessing!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, and throughout the story, we see that confusion of
purpose which is so characteristic of silly novels written by
women.&nbsp; It is a story of quite modern drawing-room
society&mdash;<!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>a society in which polkas are played
and Puseyism discussed; yet we have characters, and incidents,
and traits of manner introduced, which are mere shreds from the
most heterogeneous romances.&nbsp; We have a blind Irish harper,
&ldquo;relic of the picturesque bards of yore,&rdquo; startling
us at a Sunday-school festival of tea and cake in an English
village; we have a crazy gypsy, in a scarlet cloak, singing
snatches of romantic song, and revealing a secret on her
death-bed which, with the testimony of a dwarfish miserly
merchant, who salutes strangers with a curse and a devilish
laugh, goes to prove that Ernest, the model young clergyman, is
Kate&rsquo;s brother; and we have an ultra-virtuous Irish Barney,
discovering that a document is forged, by comparing the date of
the paper with the date of the alleged signature, although the
same document has passed through a court of law and occasioned a
fatal decision.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Hall&rdquo; in which Sir Lionel
lives is the venerable country-seat of an old family, and this,
we suppose, sets the imagination of the authoress flying to
donjons and battlements, where &ldquo;lo! the warder blows his
horn;&rdquo; for, as the inhabitants are in their bedrooms on a
night certainly within the recollection of Pleaceman X. and a
breeze springs up, which we are at first told was faint, and then
that it made the old cedars bow their branches to the greensward,
she falls into this medi&aelig;val vein of description (the
italics are ours): &ldquo;The banner <i>unfurled it</i> at the
sound, and shook its guardian wing above, while the startled owl
<i>flapped her</i> in the ivy; the firmament looking down through
her &lsquo;argus eyes&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ministers of heaven&rsquo;s mute
melodies.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And lo! two strokes tolled from out the warder tower, and
&lsquo;Two o&rsquo;clock&rsquo; re-echoed its interpreter
below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such stories as this of &ldquo;The Enigma&rdquo; remind us of
the pictures clever children sometimes draw &ldquo;out of their
own head,&rdquo; where you will see a modern villa on the right,
two knights in helmets fighting in the foreground, and a tiger
grinning in a jungle on the left, the several objects being
brought together <!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>because the artist thinks each
pretty, and perhaps still more because he remembers seeing them
in other pictures.</p>
<p>But we like the authoress much better on her medi&aelig;val
stilts than on her oracular ones&mdash;when she talks of the
<i>Ich</i> and of &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; and
&ldquo;objective,&rdquo; and lays down the exact line of
Christian verity, between &ldquo;right-hand excesses and
left-hand declensions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Persons who deviate from this
line are introduced with a patronizing air of charity.&nbsp; Of a
certain Miss Inshquine she informs us, with all the lucidity of
italics and small caps, that &ldquo;<i>function</i>, not
<i>form</i>, <span class="smcap">as</span> <i>the inevitable
outer expression of the spirit in this tabernacle age</i>, weakly
engrossed her.&rdquo;&nbsp; And <i>&agrave; propos</i> of Miss
Mayjar, an evangelical lady who is a little too apt to talk of
her visits to sick women and the state of their souls, we are
told that the model clergyman is &ldquo;not one to disallow,
through the <i>super</i> crust, the undercurrent toward good in
the <i>subject</i>, or the positive benefits, nevertheless, to
the <i>object</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We imagine the double-refined
accent and protrusion of chin which are feebly represented by the
italics in this lady&rsquo;s sentences!&nbsp; We abstain from
quoting any of her oracular doctrinal passages, because they
refer to matters too serious for our pages just now.</p>
<p>The epithet &ldquo;silly&rdquo; may seem impertinent, applied
to a novel which indicates so much reading and intellectual
activity as &ldquo;The Enigma,&rdquo; but we use this epithet
advisedly.&nbsp; If, as the world has long agreed, a very great
amount of instruction will not make a wise man, still less will a
very mediocre amount of instruction make a wise woman.&nbsp; And
the most mischievous form of feminine silliness is the literary
form, because it tends to confirm the popular prejudice against
the more solid education of women.</p>
<p>When men see girls wasting their time in consultations about
bonnets and ball dresses, and in giggling or sentimental
love-confidences, or middle-aged women mismanaging their
children, and solacing themselves with acrid gossip, they can
hardly help saying, &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, let girls be
better educated; let them have some better objects of
thought&mdash;some <!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>more solid occupations.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But after a few hours&rsquo; conversation with an oracular
literary woman, or a few hours&rsquo; reading of her books, they
are likely enough to say, &ldquo;After all, when a woman gets
some knowledge, see what use she makes of it!&nbsp; Her knowledge
remains acquisition instead of passing into culture; instead of
being subdued into modesty and simplicity by a larger
acquaintance with thought and fact, she has a feverish
consciousness of her attainments; she keeps a sort of mental
pocket-mirror, and is continually looking in it at her own
&lsquo;intellectuality;&rsquo; she spoils the taste of
one&rsquo;s muffin by questions of metaphysics; &lsquo;puts
down&rsquo; men at a dinner-table with her superior information;
and seizes the opportunity of a <i>soir&eacute;e</i> to catechise
us on the vital question of the relation between mind and
matter.&nbsp; And then, look at her writings!&nbsp; She mistakes
vagueness for depth, bombast for eloquence, and affectation for
originality; she struts on one page, rolls her eyes on another,
grimaces in a third, and is hysterical in a fourth.&nbsp; She may
have read many writings of great men, and a few writings of great
women; but she is as unable to discern the difference between her
own style and theirs as a Yorkshireman is to discern the
difference between his own English and a Londoner&rsquo;s:
rhodomontade is the native accent of her intellect.&nbsp;
No&mdash;the average nature of women is too shallow and feeble a
soil to bear much tillage; it is only fit for the very lightest
crops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that the men who come to such a decision on such
very superficial and imperfect observation may not be among the
wisest in the world; but we have not now to contest their
opinion&mdash;we are only pointing out how it is unconsciously
encouraged by many women who have volunteered themselves as
representatives of the feminine intellect.&nbsp; We do not
believe that a man was ever strengthened in such an opinion by
associating with a woman of true culture, whose mind had absorbed
her knowledge instead of being absorbed by it.&nbsp; A really
cultured woman, like a really cultured man, is all the simpler
and the less obtrusive for her knowledge; it has made her see
herself <!-- page 196--><a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>and her opinions in something like
just proportions; she does not make it a pedestal from which she
flatters herself that she commands a complete view of men and
things, but makes it a point of observation from which to form a
right estimate of herself.&nbsp; She neither spouts poetry nor
quotes Cicero on slight provocation; not because she thinks that
a sacrifice must be made to the prejudices of men, but because
that mode of exhibiting her memory and Latinity does not present
itself to her as edifying or graceful.&nbsp; She does not write
books to confound philosophers, perhaps because she is able to
write books that delight them.&nbsp; In conversation she is the
least formidable of women, because she understands you, without
wanting to make you aware that you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> understand
her.&nbsp; She does not give you information, which is the raw
material of culture&mdash;she gives you sympathy, which is its
subtlest essence.</p>
<p>A more numerous class of silly novels than the oracular (which
are generally inspired by some form of High Church or
transcendental Christianity) is what we may call the <i>white
neck-cloth</i> species, which represent the tone of thought and
feeling in the Evangelical party.&nbsp; This species is a kind of
genteel tract on a large scale, intended as a sort of medicinal
sweetmeat for Low Church young ladies; an Evangelical substitute
for the fashionable novel, as the May Meetings are a substitute
for the Opera.&nbsp; Even Quaker children, one would think, can
hardly have been denied the indulgence of a doll; but it must be
a doll dressed in a drab gown and a coal-scuttle-bonnet&mdash;not
a worldly doll, in gauze and spangles.&nbsp; And there are no
young ladies, we imagine&mdash;unless they belong to the Church
of the United Brethren, in which people are married without any
love-making&mdash;who can dispense with love stories.&nbsp; Thus,
for Evangelical young ladies there are Evangelical love stories,
in which the vicissitudes of the tender passion are sanctified by
saving views of Regeneration and the Atonement.&nbsp; These
novels differ from the oracular ones, as a Low Churchwoman often
differs from a High Churchwoman: they are a little less <!-- page
197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>supercilious and a great deal more ignorant, a little
less correct in their syntax and a great deal more vulgar.</p>
<p>The Orlando of Evangelical literature is the young curate,
looked at from the point of view of the middle class, where
cambric bands are understood to have as thrilling an effect on
the hearts of young ladies as epaulettes have in the classes
above and below it.&nbsp; In the ordinary type of these novels
the hero is almost sure to be a young curate, frowned upon,
perhaps by worldly mammas, but carrying captive the hearts of
their daughters, who can &ldquo;never forget <i>that</i>
sermon;&rdquo; tender glances are seized from the pulpit stairs
instead of the opera-box; <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes</i>
are seasoned with quotations from Scripture instead of quotations
from the poets; and questions as to the state of the
heroine&rsquo;s affections are mingled with anxieties as to the
state of her soul.&nbsp; The young curate always has a background
of well-dressed and wealthy if not fashionable society&mdash;for
Evangelical silliness is as snobbish as any other kind of
silliness&mdash;and the Evangelical lady novelist, while she
explains to you the type of the scapegoat on one page, is
ambitious on another to represent the manners and conversations
of aristocratic people.&nbsp; Her pictures of fashionable society
are often curious studies, considered as efforts of the
Evangelical imagination; but in one particular the novels of the
White Neck-cloth School are meritoriously realistic&mdash;their
favorite hero, the Evangelical young curate, is always rather an
insipid personage.</p>
<p>The most recent novel of this species that we happen to have
before us is &ldquo;The Old Grey Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
utterly tame and feeble; there is no one set of objects on which
the writer seems to have a stronger grasp than on any other; and
we should be entirely at a loss to conjecture among what phases
of life her experience has been gained, but for certain
vulgarisms of style which sufficiently indicate that she has had
the advantage, though she has been unable to use it, of mingling
chiefly with men and women whose manners and characters have not
had all their bosses and angles rubbed down by refined
conventionalism.&nbsp; It is less excusable in an Evangelical
novelist than <!-- page 198--><a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>in any other, gratuitously to seek
her subjects among titles and carriages.&nbsp; The real drama of
Evangelicalism&mdash;and it has abundance of fine drama for any
one who has genius enough to discern and reproduce it&mdash;lies
among the middle and lower classes; and are not Evangelical
opinions understood to give an especial interest in the weak
things of the earth, rather than in the mighty?&nbsp; Why, then,
cannot our Evangelical lady novelists show us the operation of
their religious views among people (there really are many such in
the world) who keep no carriage, &ldquo;not so much as a
brass-bound gig,&rdquo; who even manage to eat their dinner
without a silver fork, and in whose mouths the authoress&rsquo;s
questionable English would be strictly consistent?&nbsp; Why can
we not have pictures of religious life among the industrial
classes in England, as interesting as Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s pictures
of religious life among the negroes?&nbsp; Instead of this pious
ladies nauseate us with novels which remind us of what we
sometimes see in a worldly woman recently
&ldquo;converted;&rdquo;&mdash;she is as fond of a fine
dinner-table as before, but she invites clergymen instead of
beaux; she thinks as much of her dress as before, but she adopts
a more sober choice of colors and patterns; her conversation is
as trivial as before, but the triviality is flavored with gospel
instead of gossip.&nbsp; In &ldquo;The Old Grey Church&rdquo; we
have the same sort of Evangelical travesty of the fashionable
novel, and of course the vicious, intriguing baronet is not
wanting.&nbsp; It is worth while to give a sample of the style of
conversation attributed to this high-born rake&mdash;a style
that, in its profuse italics and palpable innuendoes, is worthy
of Miss Squeers.&nbsp; In an evening visit to the ruins of the
Colosseum, Eustace, the young clergyman, has been withdrawing the
heroine, Miss Lushington, from the rest of the party, for the
sake of a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.&nbsp; The
baronet is jealous, and vents his pique in this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There they are, and Miss Lushington, no
doubt, quite safe; for she is under the holy guidance of Pope
Eustace the First, who has, of course, been delivering to her an
edifying homily on the wickedness of the heathens of yore, who,
as tradition tells us, in this very <!-- page 199--><a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>place let
loose the wild <i>beastises</i> on poor St. Paul!&mdash;Oh, no!
by the bye, I believe I am wrong, and betraying my want of
clergy, and that it was not at all St. Paul, nor was it
here.&nbsp; But no matter, it would equally serve as a text to
preach from, and from which to diverge to the degenerate
<i>heathen</i> Christians of the present day, and all their
naughty practices, and so end with an exhortation to &lsquo;come
but from among them, and be separate;&rsquo;&mdash;and I am sure,
Miss Lushington, you have most scrupulously conformed to that
injunction this evening, for we have seen nothing of you since
our arrival.&nbsp; But every one seems agreed it has been a
<i>charming party of pleasure</i>, and I am sure we all feel
<i>much indebted</i> to Mr. Gray for having <i>suggested</i> it;
and as he seems so capital a cicerone, I hope he will think of
something else equally agreeable to <i>all</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This drivelling kind of dialogue, and equally drivelling
narrative, which, like a bad drawing, represents nothing, and
barely indicates what is meant to be represented, runs through
the book; and we have no doubt is considered by the amiable
authoress to constitute an improving novel, which Christian
mothers will do well to put into the hands of their
daughters.&nbsp; But everything is relative; we have met with
American vegetarians whose normal diet was dry meal, and who,
when their appetite wanted stimulating, tickled it with
<i>wet</i> meal; and so, we can imagine that there are
Evangelical circles in which &ldquo;The Old Grey Church&rdquo; is
devoured as a powerful and interesting fiction.</p>
<p>But perhaps the least readable of silly women&rsquo;s novels
are the <i>modern-antique</i> species, which unfold to us the
domestic life of Jannes and Jambres, the private love affairs of
Sennacherib, or the mental struggles and ultimate conversion of
Demetrius the silversmith.&nbsp; From most silly novels we can at
least extract a laugh; but those of the modern-antique school
have a ponderous, a leaden kind of fatuity, under which we
groan.&nbsp; What can be more demonstrative of the inability of
literary women to measure their own powers than their frequent
assumption of a task which can only be justified by the rarest
concurrence of acquirement with genius?&nbsp; The finest effort
to reanimate the past is of course only approximative&mdash;is
<!-- page 200--><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>always more or less an infusion of the modern spirit
into the ancient form&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Was ihr den Geist der Zeiten heisst,<br />
Das ist im Grund der Herren eigner Geist,<br />
In dem die Zeiten sich bespiegeln.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admitting that genius which has familiarized itself with all
the relics of an ancient period can sometimes, by the force of
its sympathetic divination, restore the missing notes in the
&ldquo;music of humanity,&rdquo; and reconstruct the fragments
into a whole which will really bring the remote past nearer to
us, and interpret it to our duller apprehension&mdash;this form
of imaginative power must always be among the very rarest,
because it demands as much accurate and minute knowledge as
creative vigor.&nbsp; Yet we find ladies constantly choosing to
make their mental mediocrity more conspicuous by clothing it in a
masquerade of ancient names; by putting their feeble
sentimentality into the mouths of Roman vestals or Egyptian
princesses, and attributing their rhetorical arguments to Jewish
high-priests and Greek philosophers.&nbsp; A recent example of
this heavy imbecility is &ldquo;Adonijah, a Tale of the Jewish
Dispersion,&rdquo; which forms part of a series,
&ldquo;uniting,&rdquo; we are told, &ldquo;taste, humor, and
sound principles.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Adonijah,&rdquo; we
presume, exemplifies the tale of &ldquo;sound principles;&rdquo;
the taste and humor are to be found in other members of the
series.&nbsp; We are told on the cover that the incidents of this
tale are &ldquo;fraught with unusual interest,&rdquo; and the
preface winds up thus: &ldquo;To those who feel interested in the
dispersed of Israel and Judea, these pages may afford, perhaps,
information on an important subject, as well as
amusement.&rdquo;&nbsp; Since the &ldquo;important subject&rdquo;
on which this book is to afford information is not specified, it
may possibly lie in some esoteric meaning to which we have no
key; but if it has relation to the dispersed of Israel and Judea
at any period of their history, we believe a tolerably
well-informed school-girl already knows much more of it than she
will find in this &ldquo;Tale of the Jewish
Dispersion.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Adonijah&rdquo; is simply the
feeblest kind of love story, supposed <!-- page 201--><a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>to be
instructive, we presume, because the hero is a Jewish captive and
the heroine a Roman vestal; because they and their friends are
converted to Christianity after the shortest and easiest method
approved by the &ldquo;Society for Promoting the Conversion of
the Jews;&rdquo; and because, instead of being written in plain
language, it is adorned with that peculiar style of
grandiloquence which is held by some lady novelists to give an
antique coloring, and which we recognize at once in such phrases
as these:&mdash;&ldquo;the splendid regnal talent, undoubtedly,
possessed by the Emperor Nero&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the expiring
scion of a lofty stem&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the virtuous partner of
his couch&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;ah, by Vesta!&rdquo;&mdash;and
&ldquo;I tell thee, Roman.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among the quotations
which serve at once for instruction and ornament on the cover of
this volume, there is one from Miss Sinclair, which informs us
that &ldquo;Works of imagination are <i>avowedly</i> read by men
of science, wisdom, and piety;&rdquo; from which we suppose the
reader is to gather the cheering inference that Dr. Daubeny, Mr.
Mill, or Mr. Maurice may openly indulge himself with the perusal
of &ldquo;Adonijah,&rdquo; without being obliged to secrete it
among the sofa cushions, or read it by snatches under the
dinner-table.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be not a baker if your head be made of butter,&rdquo;
says a homely proverb, which, being interpreted, may mean, let no
woman rush into print who is not prepared for the
consequences.&nbsp; We are aware that our remarks are in a very
different tone from that of the reviewers who, with perennial
recurrence of precisely similar emotions, only paralleled, we
imagine, in the experience of monthly nurses, tell one lady
novelist after another that they &ldquo;hail&rdquo; her
productions &ldquo;with delight.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are aware that
the ladies at whom our criticism is pointed are accustomed to be
told, in the choicest phraseology of puffery, that their pictures
of life are brilliant, their characters well drawn, their style
fascinating, and their sentiments lofty.&nbsp; But if they are
inclined to resent our plainness of speech, we ask them to
reflect for a moment on the chary <!-- page 202--><a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>praise, and
often captious blame, which their panegyrists give to writers
whose works are on the way to become classics.&nbsp; No sooner
does a woman show that she has genius or effective talent, than
she receives the tribute of being moderately praised and severely
criticised.&nbsp; By a peculiar thermometric adjustment, when a
woman&rsquo;s talent is at zero, journalistic approbation is at
the boiling pitch; when she attains mediocrity, it is already at
no more than summer heat; and if ever she reaches excellence,
critical enthusiasm drops to the freezing point.&nbsp; Harriet
Martineau, Currer Bell, and Mrs. Gaskell have been treated as
cavalierly as if they had been men.&nbsp; And every critic who
forms a high estimate of the share women may ultimately take in
literature, will on principle abstain from any exceptional
indulgence toward the productions of literary women.&nbsp; For it
must be plain to every one who looks impartially and extensively
into feminine literature that its greatest deficiencies are due
hardly more to the want of intellectual power than to the want of
those moral qualities that contribute to literary
excellence&mdash;patient diligence, a sense of the responsibility
involved in publication, and an appreciation of the sacredness of
the writer&rsquo;s art.&nbsp; In the majority of women&rsquo;s
books you see that kind of facility which springs from the
absence of any high standard; that fertility in imbecile
combination or feeble imitation which a little self-criticism
would check and reduce to barrenness; just as with a total want
of musical ear people will sing out of tune, while a degree more
melodic sensibility would suffice to render them silent.&nbsp;
The foolish vanity of wishing to appear in print, instead of
being counterbalanced by any consciousness of the intellectual or
moral derogation implied in futile authorship, seems to be
encouraged by the extremely false impression that to write <i>at
all</i> is a proof of superiority in a woman.&nbsp; On this
ground we believe that the average intellect of women is unfairly
represented by the mass of feminine literature, and that while
the few women who write well are very far above the ordinary
intellectual level of their sex, the many women who write ill are
very far below it.&nbsp; So <!-- page 203--><a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>that, after
all, the severer critics are fulfilling a chivalrous duty in
depriving the mere fact of feminine authorship of any false
prestige which may give it a delusive attraction, and in
recommending women of mediocre faculties&mdash;as at least a
negative service they can render their sex&mdash;to abstain from
writing.</p>
<p>The standing apology for women who become writers without any
special qualification is that society shuts them out from other
spheres of occupation.&nbsp; Society is a very culpable entity,
and has to answer for the manufacture of many unwholesome
commodities, from bad pickles to bad poetry.&nbsp; But society,
like &ldquo;matter,&rdquo; and Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government,
and other lofty abstractions, has its share of excessive blame as
well as excessive praise.&nbsp; Where there is one woman who
writes from necessity, we believe there are three women who write
from vanity; and besides, there is something so antispetic in the
mere healthy fact of working for one&rsquo;s bread, that the most
trashy and rotten kind of feminine literature is not likely to
have been produced under such circumstances.&nbsp; &ldquo;In all
labor there is profit;&rdquo; but ladies&rsquo; silly novels, we
imagine, are less the result of labor than of busy idleness.</p>
<p>Happily, we are not dependent on argument to prove that
Fiction is a department of literature in which women can, after
their kind, fully equal men.&nbsp; A cluster of great names, both
living and dead, rush to our memories in evidence that women can
produce novels not only fine, but among the very
finest&mdash;novels, too, that have a precious speciality, lying
quite apart from masculine aptitudes and experience.&nbsp; No
educational restrictions can shut women out from the materials of
fiction, and there is no species of art which is so free from
rigid requirements.&nbsp; Like crystalline masses, it may take
any form, and yet be beautiful; we have only to pour in the right
elements&mdash;genuine observation, humor, and passion.&nbsp; But
it is precisely this absence of rigid requirement which
constitutes the fatal seduction of novel-writing to incompetent
women.&nbsp; Ladies are not wont to be very grossly deceived as
to their power of playing on the piano; here certain positive
difficulties <!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>of execution have to be conquered,
and incompetence inevitably breaks down.&nbsp; Every art which
had its absolute <i>technique</i> is, to a certain extent,
guarded from the intrusions of mere left-handed imbecility.&nbsp;
But in novel-writing there are no barriers for incapacity to
stumble against, no external criteria to prevent a writer from
mistaking foolish facility for mastery.&nbsp; And so we have
again and again the old story of La Fontaine&rsquo;s ass, who
pats his nose to the flute, and, finding that he elicits some
sound, exclaims, &ldquo;Moi, aussie, je joue de la
flute&rdquo;&mdash;a fable which we commend, at parting, to the
consideration of any feminine reader who is in danger of adding
to the number of &ldquo;silly novels by lady
novelists.&rdquo;</p>
