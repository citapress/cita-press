Edit a collection? Sponsor a book of a particular author? In the future, we’d be particularly interested in expanding 
into poetry, Spanish-language, books by women of color, queer and non-binary folks, and publish contemporary writing!  This project is a collaborative effort of love made possible by the generosity of our <a href="https://citapress.org/#credits">contributors</a>.</p>
