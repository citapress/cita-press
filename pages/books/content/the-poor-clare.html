  <h2 id="chapter1"> CHAPTER I. </h2>
<p><span class="smcap">December</span> 12th, 1747.&mdash;My life
has been strangely bound up with extraordinary incidents, some of
which occurred before I had any connection with the principal
actors in them, or indeed, before I even knew of their
existence.&nbsp; I suppose, most old men are, like me, more given
to looking back upon their own career with a kind of fond
interest and affectionate remembrance, than to watching the
events&mdash;though these may have far more interest for the
multitude&mdash;immediately passing before their eyes.&nbsp; If
this should be the case with the generality of old people, how
much more so with me! . . . If I am to enter upon that strange
story connected with poor Lucy, I must begin a long way
back.&nbsp; I myself only came to the knowledge of her family
history after I knew her; but, to make the tale clear to any one
else, I must arrange events in the order in which they
occurred&mdash;not that in which I became acquainted with
them.</p>
<p>There is a great old hall in the north-east of Lancashire, in
a part they called the Trough of Bolland, adjoining that other
district named Craven.&nbsp; Starkey Manor-house is rather like a
number of rooms clustered round a gray, massive, old keep than a
regularly-built hall.&nbsp; Indeed, I suppose that the house only
consisted of a great tower in the centre, in the days when the
Scots made their raids terrible as far south as this; and that
after the Stuarts came in, and there was a little more security
of property in those parts, the Starkeys of that time added the
lower building, which runs, two stories high, all round the base
of the keep.&nbsp; There has been a grand garden laid out in my
days, on the southern slope near the house; but when I first knew
the place, the kitchen-garden at the farm was the only piece of
cultivated ground belonging to it.&nbsp; The deer used to come
within sight of the drawing-room windows, and might have browsed
quite close up to the house if they had not been too wild and
shy.&nbsp; Starkey Manor-house itself stood on a projection or
peninsula of high land, jutting out from the abrupt hills that
form the sides of the Trough of Bolland.&nbsp; These hills were
rocky and bleak enough towards their summit; lower down they were
clothed with tangled copsewood and green depths of fern, out of
which a gray giant of an ancient forest-tree would tower here and
there, throwing up its ghastly white branches, as if in
imprecation, to the sky.&nbsp; These trees, they told me, were
the remnants of that forest which existed in the days of the
Heptarchy, and were even then noted as landmarks.&nbsp; No wonder
that their upper and more exposed branches were leafless, and
that the dead bark had peeled away, from sapless old age.</p>
<p>Not far from the house there were a few cottages, apparently,
of the same date as the keep; probably built for some retainers
of the family, who sought shelter&mdash;they and their families
and their small flocks and herds&mdash;at the hands of their
feudal lord.&nbsp; Some of them had pretty much fallen to
decay.&nbsp; They were built in a strange fashion.&nbsp; Strong
beams had been sunk firm in the ground at the requisite distance,
and their other ends had been fastened together, two and two, so
as to form the shape of one of those rounded waggon-headed
gipsy-tents, only very much larger.&nbsp; The spaces between were
filled with mud, stones, osiers, rubbish, mortar&mdash;anything
to keep out the weather.&nbsp; The fires were made in the centre
of these rude dwellings, a hole in the roof forming the only
chimney.&nbsp; No Highland hut or Irish cabin could be of rougher
construction.</p>
<p>The owner of this property, at the beginning of the present
century, was a Mr. Patrick Byrne Starkey.&nbsp; His family had
kept to the old faith, and were stanch Roman Catholics, esteeming
it even a sin to marry any one of Protestant descent, however
willing he or she might have been to embrace the Romish
religion.&nbsp; Mr. Patrick Starkey&rsquo;s father had been a
follower of James the Second; and, during the disastrous Irish
campaign of that monarch he had fallen in love with an Irish
beauty, a Miss Byrne, as zealous for her religion and for the
Stuarts as himself.&nbsp; He had returned to Ireland after his
escape to France, and married her, bearing her back to the court
at St. Germains.&nbsp; But some licence on the part of the
disorderly gentlemen who surrounded King James in his exile, had
insulted his beautiful wife, and disgusted him; so he removed
from St. Germains to Antwerp, whence, in a few years&rsquo; time,
he quietly returned to Starkey Manor-house&mdash;some of his
Lancashire neighbours having lent their good offices to reconcile
him to the powers that were.&nbsp; He was as firm a Catholic as
ever, and as stanch an advocate for the Stuarts and the divine
rights of kings; but his religion almost amounted to asceticism,
and the conduct of these with whom he had been brought in such
close contact at St. Germains would little bear the inspection of
a stern moralist.&nbsp; So he gave his allegiance where he could
not give his esteem, and learned to respect sincerely the upright
and moral character of one whom he yet regarded as an
usurper.&nbsp; King William&rsquo;s government had little need to
fear such a one.&nbsp; So he returned, as I have said, with a
sobered heart and impoverished fortunes, to his ancestral house,
which had fallen sadly to ruin while the owner had been a
courtier, a soldier, and an exile.&nbsp; The roads into the
Trough of Bolland were little more than cart-ruts; indeed, the
way up to the house lay along a ploughed field before you came to
the deer-park.&nbsp; Madam, as the country-folk used to call Mrs.
Starkey, rode on a pillion behind her husband, holding on to him
with a light hand by his leather riding-belt.&nbsp; Little master
(he that was afterwards Squire Patrick Byrne Starkey) was held on
to his pony by a serving-man.&nbsp; A woman past middle age
walked, with a firm and strong step, by the cart that held much
of the baggage; and high up on the mails and boxes, sat a girl of
dazzling beauty, perched lightly on the topmost trunk, and
swaying herself fearlessly to and fro, as the cart rocked and
shook in the heavy roads of late autumn.&nbsp; The girl wore the
Antwerp faille, or black Spanish mantle over her head, and
altogether her appearance was such that the old cottager, who
described the possession to me many years after, said that all
the country-folk took her for a foreigner.&nbsp; Some dogs, and
the boy who held them in charge, made up the company.&nbsp; They
rode silently along, looking with grave, serious eyes at the
people, who came out of the scattered cottages to bow or curtsy
to the real Squire, &ldquo;come back at last,&rdquo; and gazed
after the little procession with gaping wonder, not deadened by
the sound of the foreign language in which the few necessary
words that passed among them were spoken.&nbsp; One lad, called
from his staring by the Squire to come and help about the cart,
accompanied them to the Manor-house.&nbsp; He said that when the
lady had descended from her pillion, the middle-aged woman whom I
have described as walking while the others rode, stepped quickly
forward, and taking Madam Starkey (who was of a slight and
delicate figure) in her arms, she lifted her over the threshold,
and set her down in her husband&rsquo;s house, at the same time
uttering a passionate and outlandish blessing.&nbsp; The Squire
stood by, smiling gravely at first; but when the words of
blessing were pronounced, he took off his fine feathered hat, and
bent his head.&nbsp; The girl with the black mantle stepped
onward into the shadow of the dark hall, and kissed the
lady&rsquo;s hand; and that was all the lad could tell to the
group that gathered round him on his return, eager to hear
everything, and to know how much the Squire had given him for his
services.</p>
<p>From all I could gather, the Manor-house, at the time of the
Squire&rsquo;s return, was in the most dilapidated state.&nbsp;
The stout gray walls remained firm and entire; but the inner
chambers had been used for all kinds of purposes.&nbsp; The great
withdrawing-room had been a barn; the state tapestry-chamber had
held wool, and so on.&nbsp; But, by-and-by, they were cleared
out; and if the Squire had no money to spend on new furniture, he
and his wife had the knack of making the best of the old.&nbsp;
He was no despicable joiner; she had a kind of grace in whatever
she did, and imparted an air of elegant picturesqueness to
whatever she touched.&nbsp; Besides, they had brought many rare
things from the Continent; perhaps I should rather say, things
that were rare in that part of England&mdash;carvings, and
crosses, and beautiful pictures.&nbsp; And then, again, wood was
plentiful in the Trough of Bolland, and great log-fires danced
and glittered in all the dark, old rooms, and gave a look of home
and comfort to everything.</p>
<p>Why do I tell you all this?&nbsp; I have little to do with the
Squire and Madame Starkey; and yet I dwell upon them, as if I
were unwilling to come to the real people with whom my life was
so strangely mixed up.&nbsp; Madam had been nursed in Ireland by
the very woman who lifted her in her arms, and welcomed her to
her husband&rsquo;s home in Lancashire.&nbsp; Excepting for the
short period of her own married life, Bridget Fitzgerald had
never left her nursling.&nbsp; Her marriage&mdash;to one above
her in rank&mdash;had been unhappy.&nbsp; Her husband had died,
and left her in even greater poverty than that in which she was
when he had first met with her.&nbsp; She had one child, the
beautiful daughter who came riding on the waggon-load of
furniture that was brought to the Manor-house.&nbsp; Madame
Starkey had taken her again into her service when she became a
widow.&nbsp; She and her daughter had followed &ldquo;the
mistress&rdquo; in all her fortunes; they had lived at St.
Germains and at Antwerp, and were now come to her home in
Lancashire.&nbsp; As soon as Bridget had arrived there, the
Squire gave her a cottage of her own, and took more pains in
furnishing it for her than he did in anything else out of his own
house.&nbsp; It was only nominally her residence.&nbsp; She was
constantly up at the great house; indeed, it was but a short cut
across the woods from her own home to the home of her
nursling.&nbsp; Her daughter Mary, in like manner, moved from one
house to the other at her own will.&nbsp; Madam loved both mother
and child dearly.&nbsp; They had great influence over her, and,
through her, over her husband.&nbsp; Whatever Bridget or Mary
willed was sure to come to pass.&nbsp; They were not disliked;
for, though wild and passionate, they were also generous by
nature.&nbsp; But the other servants were afraid of them, as
being in secret the ruling spirits of the household.&nbsp; The
Squire had lost his interest in all secular things; Madam was
gentle, affectionate, and yielding.&nbsp; Both husband and wife
were tenderly attached to each other and to their boy; but they
grew more and more to shun the trouble of decision on any point;
and hence it was that Bridget could exert such despotic
power.&nbsp; But if everyone else yielded to her &ldquo;magic of
a superior mind,&rdquo; her daughter not unfrequently
rebelled.&nbsp; She and her mother were too much alike to
agree.&nbsp; There were wild quarrels between them, and wilder
reconciliations.&nbsp; There were times when, in the heat of
passion, they could have stabbed each other.&nbsp; At all other
times they both&mdash;Bridget especially&mdash;would have
willingly laid down their lives for one another.&nbsp;
Bridget&rsquo;s love for her child lay very deep&mdash;deeper
than that daughter ever knew; or I should think she would never
have wearied of home as she did, and prayed her mistress to
obtain for her some situation&mdash;as waiting maid&mdash;beyond
the seas, in that more cheerful continental life, among the
scenes of which so many of her happiest years had been
spent.&nbsp; She thought, as youth thinks, that life would last
for ever, and that two or three years were but a small portion of
it to pass away from her mother, whose only child she was.&nbsp;
Bridget thought differently, but was too proud ever to show what
she felt.&nbsp; If her child wished to leave her, why&mdash;she
should go.&nbsp; But people said Bridget became ten years older
in the course of two months at this time.&nbsp; She took it that
Mary wanted to leave her.&nbsp; The truth was, that Mary wanted
for a time to leave the place, and to seek some change, and would
thankfully have taken her mother with her.&nbsp; Indeed when
Madam Starkey had gotten her a situation with some grand lady
abroad, and the time drew near for her to go, it was Mary who
clung to her mother with passionate embrace, and, with floods of
tears, declared that she would never leave her; and it was
Bridget, who at last loosened her arms, and, grave and tearless
herself, bade her keep her word, and go forth into the wide
world.&nbsp; Sobbing aloud, and looking back continually, Mary
went away.&nbsp; Bridget was still as death, scarcely drawing her
breath, or closing her stony eyes; till at last she turned back
into her cottage, and heaved a ponderous old settle against the
door.&nbsp; There she sat, motionless, over the gray ashes of her
extinguished fire, deaf to Madam&rsquo;s sweet voice, as she
begged leave to enter and comfort her nurse.&nbsp; Deaf, stony,
and motionless, she sat for more than twenty hours; till, for the
third time, Madam came across the snowy path from the great
house, carrying with her a young spaniel, which had been
Mary&rsquo;s pet up at the hall; and which had not ceased all
night long to seek for its absent mistress, and to whine and moan
after her.&nbsp; With tears Madam told this story, through the
closed door&mdash;tears excited by the terrible look of anguish,
so steady, so immovable&mdash;so the same to-day as it was
yesterday&mdash;on her nurse&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; The little
creature in her arms began to utter its piteous cry, as it
shivered with the cold.&nbsp; Bridget stirred; she
moved&mdash;she listened.&nbsp; Again that long whine; she
thought it was for her daughter; and what she had denied to her
nursling and mistress she granted to the dumb creature that Mary
had cherished.&nbsp; She opened the door, and took the dog from
Madam&rsquo;s arms.&nbsp; Then Madam came in, and kissed and
comforted the old woman, who took but little notice of her or
anything.&nbsp; And sending up Master Patrick to the hall for
fire and food, the sweet young lady never left her nurse all that
night.&nbsp; Next day, the Squire himself came down, carrying a
beautiful foreign picture&mdash;Our Lady of the Holy Heart, the
Papists call it.&nbsp; It is a picture of the Virgin, her heart
pierced with arrows, each arrow representing one of her great
woes.&nbsp; That picture hung in Bridget&rsquo;s cottage when I
first saw her; I have that picture now.</p>
<p>Years went on.&nbsp; Mary was still abroad.&nbsp; Bridget was
still and stern, instead of active and passionate.&nbsp; The
little dog, Mignon, was indeed her darling.&nbsp; I have heard
that she talked to it continually; although, to most people, she
was so silent.&nbsp; The Squire and Madam treated her with the
greatest consideration, and well they might; for to them she was
as devoted and faithful as ever.&nbsp; Mary wrote pretty often,
and seemed satisfied with her life.&nbsp; But at length the
letters ceased&mdash;I hardly know whether before or after a
great and terrible sorrow came upon the house of the
Starkeys.&nbsp; The Squire sickened of a putrid fever; and Madam
caught it in nursing him, and died.&nbsp; You may be sure,
Bridget let no other woman tend her but herself; and in the very
arms that had received her at her birth, that sweet young woman
laid her head down, and gave up her breath.&nbsp; The Squire
recovered, in a fashion.&nbsp; He was never strong&mdash;he had
never the heart to smile again.&nbsp; He fasted and prayed more
than ever; and people did say that he tried to cut off the
entail, and leave all the property away to found a monastery
abroad, of which he prayed that some day little Squire Patrick
might be the reverend father.&nbsp; But he could not do this, for
the strictness of the entail and the laws against the
Papists.&nbsp; So he could only appoint gentlemen of his own
faith as guardians to his son, with many charges about the
lad&rsquo;s soul, and a few about the land, and the way it was to
be held while he was a minor.&nbsp; Of course, Bridget was not
forgotten.&nbsp; He sent for her as he lay on his death-bed, and
asked her if she would rather have a sum down, or have a small
annuity settled upon her.&nbsp; She said at once she would have a
sum down; for she thought of her daughter, and how she could
bequeath the money to her, whereas an annuity would have died
with her.&nbsp; So the Squire left her her cottage for life, and
a fair sum of money.&nbsp; And then he died, with as ready and
willing a heart as, I suppose, ever any gentleman took out of
this world with him.&nbsp; The young Squire was carried off by
his guardians, and Bridget was left alone.</p>
<p>I have said that she had not heard from Mary for some
time.&nbsp; In her last letter, she had told of travelling about
with her mistress, who was the English wife of some great foreign
officer, and had spoken of her chances of making a good marriage,
without naming the gentleman&rsquo;s name, keeping it rather back
as a pleasant surprise to her mother; his station and fortune
being, as I had afterwards reason to know, far superior to
anything she had a right to expect.&nbsp; Then came a long
silence; and Madam was dead, and the Squire was dead; and
Bridget&rsquo;s heart was gnawed by anxiety, and she knew not
whom to ask for news of her child.&nbsp; She could not write, and
the Squire had managed her communication with her daughter.&nbsp;
She walked off to Hurst; and got a good priest there&mdash;one
whom she had known at Antwerp&mdash;to write for her.&nbsp; But
no answer came.&nbsp; It was like crying into the&rsquo; awful
stillness of night.</p>
<p>One day, Bridget was missed by those neighbours who had been
accustomed to mark her goings-out and comings-in.&nbsp; She had
never been sociable with any of them; but the sight of her had
become a part of their daily lives, and slow wonder arose in
their minds, as morning after morning came, and her house-door
remained closed, her window dead from any glitter, or light of
fire within.&nbsp; At length, some one tried the door; it was
locked.&nbsp; Two or three laid their heads together, before
daring to look in through the blank unshuttered window.&nbsp;
But, at last, they summoned up courage; and then saw that
Bridget&rsquo;s absence from their little world was not the
result of accident or death, but of premeditation.&nbsp; Such
small articles of furniture as could be secured from the effects
of time and damp by being packed up, were stowed away in
boxes.&nbsp; The picture of the Madonna was taken down, and
gone.&nbsp; In a word, Bridget had stolen away from her home, and
left no trace whither she was departed.&nbsp; I knew afterwards,
that she and her little dog had wandered off on the long search
for her lost daughter.&nbsp; She was too illiterate to have faith
in letters, even had she had the means of writing and sending
many.&nbsp; But she had faith in her own strong love, and
believed that her passionate instinct would guide her to her
child.&nbsp; Besides, foreign travel was no new thing to her, and
she could speak enough of French to explain the object of her
journey, and had, moreover, the advantage of being, from her
faith, a welcome object of charitable hospitality at many a
distant convent.&nbsp; But the country people round Starkey
Manor-house knew nothing of all this.&nbsp; They wondered what
had become of her, in a torpid, lazy fashion, and then left off
thinking of her altogether.&nbsp; Several years passed.&nbsp;
Both Manor-house and cottage were deserted.&nbsp; The young
Squire lived far away under the direction of his guardians.&nbsp;
There were inroads of wool and corn into the sitting-rooms of the
Hall; and there was some low talk, from time to time, among the
hinds and country people whether it would not be as well to break
into old Bridget&rsquo;s cottage, and save such of her goods as
were left from the moth and rust which must be making sad
havoc.&nbsp; But this idea was always quenched by the
recollection of her strong character and passionate anger; and
tales of her masterful spirit, and vehement force of will, were
whispered about, till the very thought of offending her, by
touching any article of hers, became invested with a kind of
horror: it was believed that, dead or alive, she would not fail
to avenge it.</p>
<p>Suddenly she came home; with as little noise or note of
preparation as she had departed.&nbsp; One day some one noticed a
thin, blue curl of smoke ascending from her chimney.&nbsp; Her
door stood open to the noonday sun; and, ere many hours had
elapsed, some one had seen an old travel-and-sorrow-stained woman
dipping her pitcher in the well; and said, that the dark, solemn
eyes that looked up at him were more like Bridget
Fitzgerald&rsquo;s than any one else&rsquo;s in this world; and
yet, if it were she, she looked as if she had been scorched in
the flames of hell, so brown, and scared, and fierce a creature
did she seem.&nbsp; By-and-by many saw her; and those who met her
eye once cared not to be caught looking at her again.&nbsp; She
had got into the habit of perpetually talking to herself; nay,
more, answering herself, and varying her tones according to the
side she took at the moment.&nbsp; It was no wonder that those
who dared to listen outside her door at night believed that she
held converse with some spirit; in short, she was unconsciously
earning for herself the dreadful reputation of a witch.</p>
<p>Her little dog, which had wandered half over the Continent
with her, was her only companion; a dumb remembrancer of happier
days.&nbsp; Once he was ill; and she carried him more than three
miles, to ask about his management from one who had been groom to
the last Squire, and had then been noted for his skill in all
diseases of animals.&nbsp; Whatever this man did, the dog
recovered; and they who heard her thanks, intermingled with
blessings (that were rather promises of good fortune than
prayers), looked grave at his good luck when, next year, his ewes
twinned, and his meadow-grass was heavy and thick.</p>
<p>Now it so happened that, about the year seventeen hundred and
eleven, one of the guardians of the young squire, a certain Sir
Philip Tempest, bethought him of the good shooting there must be
on his ward&rsquo;s property; and in consequence he brought down
four or five gentlemen, of his friends, to stay for a week or two
at the Hall.&nbsp; From all accounts, they roystered and spent
pretty freely.&nbsp; I never heard any of their names but one,
and that was Squire Gisborne&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was hardly a
middle-aged man then; he had been much abroad, and there, I
believe, he had known Sir Philip Tempest, and done him some
service.&nbsp; He was a daring and dissolute fellow in those
days: careless and fearless, and one who would rather be in a
quarrel than out of it.&nbsp; He had his fits of ill-temper
besides, when he would spare neither man nor beast.&nbsp;
Otherwise, those who knew him well, used to say he had a good
heart, when he was neither drunk, nor angry, nor in any way
vexed.&nbsp; He had altered much when I came to know him.</p>
<p>One day, the gentlemen had all been out shooting, and with but
little success, I believe; anyhow, Mr. Gisborne had none, and was
in a black humour accordingly.&nbsp; He was coming home, having
his gun loaded, sportsman-like, when little Mignon crossed his
path, just as he turned out of the wood by Bridget&rsquo;s
cottage.&nbsp; Partly for wantonness, partly to vent his spleen
upon some living creature.&nbsp; Mr. Gisborne took his gun, and
fired&mdash;he had better have never fired gun again, than aimed
that unlucky shot, he hit Mignon, and at the creature&rsquo;s
sudden cry, Bridget came out, and saw at a glance what had been
done.&nbsp; She took Mignon up in her arms, and looked hard at
the wound; the poor dog looked at her with his glazing eyes, and
tried to wag his tail and lick her hand, all covered with
blood.&nbsp; Mr. Gisborne spoke in a kind of sullen
penitence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have kept the dog out of my way&mdash;a
little poaching varmint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this very moment, Mignon stretched out his legs, and
stiffened in her arms&mdash;her lost Mary&rsquo;s dog, who had
wandered and sorrowed with her for years.&nbsp; She walked right
into Mr. Gisborne&rsquo;s path, and fixed his unwilling, sullen
look, with her dark and terrible eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those never throve that did me harm,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m alone in the world, and helpless; the
more do the saints in heaven hear my prayers.&nbsp; Hear me, ye
blessed ones! hear me while I ask for sorrow on this bad, cruel
man.&nbsp; He has killed the only creature that loved
me&mdash;the dumb beast that I loved.&nbsp; Bring down heavy
sorrow on his head for it, O ye saints!&nbsp; He thought that I
was helpless, because he saw me lonely and poor; but are not the
armies of heaven for the like of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said he, half remorseful, but not
one whit afraid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a crown to buy thee
another dog.&nbsp; Take it, and leave off cursing!&nbsp; I care
none for thy threats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said she, coming a step closer,
and changing her imprecatory cry for a whisper which made the
gamekeeper&rsquo;s lad, following Mr. Gisborne, creep all
over.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall live to see the creature you love
best, and who alone loves you&mdash;ay, a human creature, but as
innocent and fond as my poor, dead darling&mdash;you shall see
this creature, for whom death would be too happy, become a terror
and a loathing to all, for this blood&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Hear
me, O holy saints, who never fail them that have no other
help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw up her right hand, filled with poor Mignon&rsquo;s
life-drops; they spirted, one or two of them, on his
shooting-dress,&mdash;an ominous sight to the follower.&nbsp; But
the master only laughed a little, forced, scornful laugh, and
went on to the Hall.&nbsp; Before he got there, however, he took
out a gold piece, and bade the boy carry it to the old woman on
his return to the village.&nbsp; The lad was
&ldquo;afeared,&rdquo; as he told me in after years; he came to
the cottage, and hovered about, not daring to enter.&nbsp; He
peeped through the window at last; and by the flickering
wood-flame, he saw Bridget kneeling before the picture of Our
Lady of the Holy Heart, with dead Mignon lying between her and
the Madonna.&nbsp; She was praying wildly, as her outstretched
arms betokened.&nbsp; The lad shrunk away in redoubled terror;
and contented himself with slipping the gold piece under the
ill-fitting door.&nbsp; The next day it was thrown out upon the
midden; and there it lay, no one daring to touch it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Gisborne, half curious, half uneasy, thought to
lessen his uncomfortable feelings by asking Sir Philip who
Bridget was?&nbsp; He could only describe her&mdash;he did not
know her name.&nbsp; Sir Philip was equally at a loss.&nbsp; But
an old servant of the Starkeys, who had resumed his livery at the
Hall on this occasion&mdash;a scoundrel whom Bridget had saved
from dismissal more than once during her palmy
days&mdash;said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be the old witch, that his worship means.&nbsp;
She needs a ducking, if ever a woman did, does that Bridget
Fitzgerald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fitzgerald!&rdquo; said both the gentlemen at
once.&nbsp; But Sir Philip was the first to continue:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have no talk of ducking her, Dickon.&nbsp; Why,
she must be the very woman poor Starkey bade me have a care of;
but when I came here last she was gone, no one knew where.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll go and see her to-morrow.&nbsp; But mind you, sirrah,
if any harm comes to her, or any more talk of her being a
witch&mdash;I&rsquo;ve a pack of hounds at home, who can follow
the scent of a lying knave as well as ever they followed a
dog-fox; so take care how you talk about ducking a faithful old
servant of your dead master&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had she ever a daughter?&rdquo; asked Mr. Gisborne,
after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;yes!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a notion
she had; a kind of waiting woman to Madam Starkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please your worship,&rdquo; said humbled Dickon,
&ldquo;Mistress Bridget had a daughter&mdash;one Mistress
Mary&mdash;who went abroad, and has never been heard on since;
and folk do say that has crazed her mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Gisborne shaded his eyes with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could wish she had not cursed me,&rdquo; he
muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;She may have power&mdash;no one else
could.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a while, he said aloud, no one
understanding rightly what he meant, &ldquo;Tush! it is
impossible!&rdquo;&mdash;and called for claret; and he and the
other gentlemen set-to to a drinking-bout.</p>
 <h2 id="chapter2"> CHAPTER II. </h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">now</span> come to the time in which I
myself was mixed up with the people that I have been writing
about.&nbsp; And to make you understand how I became connected
with them, I must give you some little account of myself.&nbsp;
My father was the younger son of a Devonshire gentleman of
moderate property; my eldest uncle succeeded to the estate of his
forefathers, my second became an eminent attorney in London, and
my father took orders.&nbsp; Like most poor clergymen, he had a
large family; and I have no doubt was glad enough when my London
uncle, who was a bachelor, offered to take charge of me, and
bring me up to be his successor in business.</p>
<p>In this way I came to live in London, in my uncle&rsquo;s
house, not far from Gray&rsquo;s Inn, and to be treated and
esteemed as his son, and to labour with him in his office.&nbsp;
I was very fond of the old gentleman.&nbsp; He was the
confidential agent of many country squires, and had attained to
his present position as much by knowledge of human nature as by
knowledge of law; though he was learned enough in the
latter.&nbsp; He used to say his business was law, his pleasure
heraldry.&nbsp; From his intimate acquaintance with family
history, and all the tragic courses of life therein involved, to
hear him talk, at leisure times, about any coat of arms that came
across his path was as good as a play or a romance.&nbsp; Many
cases of disputed property, dependent on a love of genealogy,
were brought to him, as to a great authority on such
points.&nbsp; If the lawyer who came to consult him was young, he
would take no fee, only give him a long lecture on the importance
of attending to heraldry; if the lawyer was of mature age and
good standing, he would mulct him pretty well, and abuse him to
me afterwards as negligent of one great branch of the
profession.&nbsp; His house was in a stately new street called
Ormond Street, and in it he had a handsome library; but all the
books treated of things that were past; none of them planned or
looked forward into the future.&nbsp; I worked away&mdash;partly
for the sake of my family at home, partly because my uncle had
really taught me to enjoy the kind of practice in which he
himself took such delight.&nbsp; I suspect I worked too hard; at
any rate, in seventeen hundred and eighteen I was far from well,
and my good uncle was disturbed by my ill looks.</p>
<p>One day, he rang the bell twice into the clerk&rsquo;s room at
the dingy office in Grey&rsquo;s Inn Lane.&nbsp; It was the
summons for me, and I went into his private room just as a
gentleman&mdash;whom I knew well enough by sight as an Irish
lawyer of more reputation than he deserved&mdash;was leaving.</p>
<p>My uncle was slowly rubbing his hands together and
considering.&nbsp; I was there two or three minutes before he
spoke.&nbsp; Then he told me that I must pack up my portmanteau
that very afternoon, and start that night by post-horse for West
Chester.&nbsp; I should get there, if all went well, at the end
of five days&rsquo; time, and must then wait for a packet to
cross over to Dublin; from thence I must proceed to a certain
town named Kildoon, and in that neighbourhood I was to remain,
making certain inquiries as to the existence of any descendants
of the younger branch of a family to whom some valuable estates
had descended in the female line.&nbsp; The Irish lawyer whom I
had seen was weary of the case, and would willingly have given up
the property, without further ado, to a man who appeared to claim
them; but on laying his tables and trees before my uncle, the
latter had foreseen so many possible prior claimants, that the
lawyer had begged him to undertake the management of the whole
business.&nbsp; In his youth, my uncle would have liked nothing
better than going over to Ireland himself, and ferreting out
every scrap of paper or parchment, and every word of tradition
respecting the family.&nbsp; As it was, old and gouty, he deputed
me.</p>
<p>Accordingly, I went to Kildoon.&nbsp; I suspect I had
something of my uncle&rsquo;s delight in following up a
genealogical scent, for I very soon found out, when on the spot,
that Mr. Rooney, the Irish lawyer, would have got both himself
and the first claimant into a terrible scrape, if he had
pronounced his opinion that the estates ought to be given up to
him.&nbsp; There were three poor Irish fellows, each nearer of
kin to the last possessor; but, a generation before, there was a
still nearer relation, who had never been accounted for, nor his
existence ever discovered by the lawyers, I venture to think,
till I routed him out from the memory of some of the old
dependants of the family.&nbsp; What had become of him?&nbsp; I
travelled backwards and forwards; I crossed over to France, and
came back again with a slight clue, which ended in my discovering
that, wild and dissipated himself, he had left one child, a son,
of yet worse character than his father; that this same Hugh
Fitzgerald had married a very beautiful serving-woman of the
Byrnes&mdash;a person below him in hereditary rank, but above him
in character; that he had died soon after his marriage, leaving
one child, whether a boy or a girl I could not learn, and that
the mother had returned to live in the family of the
Byrnes.&nbsp; Now, the chief of this latter family was serving in
the Duke of Berwick&rsquo;s regiment, and it was long before I
could hear from him; it was more than a year before I got a
short, haughty letter&mdash;I fancy he had a soldier&rsquo;s
contempt for a civilian, an Irishman&rsquo;s hatred for an
Englishman, an exiled Jacobite&rsquo;s jealousy of one who
prospered and lived tranquilly under the government he looked
upon as an usurpation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bridget Fitzgerald,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;had been faithful to the fortunes of his
sister&mdash;had followed her abroad, and to England when Mrs.
Starkey had thought fit to return.&nbsp; Both his sister and her
husband were dead, he knew nothing of Bridget Fitzgerald at the
present time: probably Sir Philip Tempest, his nephew&rsquo;s
guardian, might be able to give me some information.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I have not given the little contemptuous terms; the way in which
faithful service was meant to imply more than it said&mdash;all
that has nothing to do with my story.&nbsp; Sir Philip, when
applied to, told me that he paid an annuity regularly to an old
woman named Fitzgerald, living at Coldholme (the village near
Starkey Manor-house).&nbsp; Whether she had any descendants he
could not say.</p>
<p>One bleak March evening, I came in sight of the places
described at the beginning of my story.&nbsp; I could hardly
understand the rude dialect in which the direction to old
Bridget&rsquo;s house was given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; see yon furleets,&rdquo; all run together,
gave me no idea that I was to guide myself by the distant lights
that shone in the windows of the Hall, occupied for the time by a
farmer who held the post of steward, while the Squire, now four
or five and twenty, was making the grand tour.&nbsp; However, at
last, I reached Bridget&rsquo;s cottage&mdash;a low, moss-grown
place: the palings that had once surrounded it were broken and
gone; and the underwood of the forest came up to the walls, and
must have darkened the windows.&nbsp; It was about seven
o&rsquo;clock&mdash;not late to my London notions&mdash;but,
after knocking for some time at the door and receiving no reply,
I was driven to conjecture that the occupant of the house was
gone to bed.&nbsp; So I betook myself to the nearest church I had
seen, three miles back on the road I had come, sure that close to
that I should find an inn of some kind; and early the next
morning I set off back to Coldholme, by a field-path which my
host assured me I should find a shorter cut than the road I had
taken the night before.&nbsp; It was a cold, sharp morning; my
feet left prints in the sprinkling of hoar-frost that covered the
ground; nevertheless, I saw an old woman, whom I instinctively
suspected to be the object of my search, in a sheltered covert on
one side of my path.&nbsp; I lingered and watched her.&nbsp; She
must have been considerably above the middle size in her prime,
for when she raised herself from the stooping position in which I
first saw her, there was something fine and commanding in the
erectness of her figure.&nbsp; She drooped again in a minute or
two, and seemed looking for something on the ground, as, with
bent head, she turned off from the spot where I gazed upon her,
and was lost to my sight.&nbsp; I fancy I missed my way, and made
a round in spite of the landlord&rsquo;s directions; for by the
time I had reached Bridget&rsquo;s cottage she was there, with no
semblance of hurried walk or discomposure of any kind.&nbsp; The
door was slightly ajar.&nbsp; I knocked, and the majestic figure
stood before me, silently awaiting the explanation of my
errand.&nbsp; Her teeth were all gone, so the nose and chin were
brought near together; the gray eyebrows were straight, and
almost hung over her deep, cavernous eyes, and the thick white
hair lay in silvery masses over the low, wide, wrinkled
forehead.&nbsp; For a moment, I stood uncertain how to shape my
answer to the solemn questioning of her silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name is Bridget Fitzgerald, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bowed her head in assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something to say to you.&nbsp; May I come
in?&nbsp; I am unwilling to keep you standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot tire me,&rdquo; she said, and at first she
seemed inclined to deny me the shelter of her roof.&nbsp; But the
next moment&mdash;she had searched the very soul in me with her
eyes during that instant&mdash;she led me in, and dropped the
shadowing hood of her gray, draping cloak, which had previously
hid part of the character of her countenance.&nbsp; The cottage
was rude and bare enough.&nbsp; But before the picture of the
Virgin, of which I have made mention, there stood a little cup
filled with fresh primroses.&nbsp; While she paid her reverence
to the Madonna, I understood why she had been out seeking through
the clumps of green in the sheltered copse.&nbsp; Then she turned
round, and bade me be seated.&nbsp; The expression of her face,
which all this time I was studying, was not bad, as the stories
of my last night&rsquo;s landlord had led me to expect; it was a
wild, stern, fierce, indomitable countenance, seamed and scarred
by agonies of solitary weeping; but it was neither cunning nor
malignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Bridget Fitzgerald,&rdquo; said she, by way
of opening our conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your husband was Hugh Fitzgerald, of Knock Mahon,
near Kildoon, in Ireland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint light came into the dark gloom of her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask if you had any children by him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light in her eyes grew quick and red.&nbsp; She tried to
speak, I could see; but something rose in her throat, and choked
her, and until she could speak calmly, she would fain not speak
at all before a stranger.&nbsp; In a minute or so she
said&mdash;&ldquo;I had a daughter&mdash;one Mary
Fitzgerald,&rdquo;&mdash;then her strong nature mastered her
strong will, and she cried out, with a trembling wailing cry:
&ldquo;Oh, man! what of her?&mdash;what of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from her seat, and came and clutched at my arm, and
looked in my eyes.&nbsp; There she read, as I suppose, my utter
ignorance of what had become of her child; for she went blindly
back to her chair, and sat rocking herself and softly moaning, as
if I were not there; I not daring to speak to the lone and awful
woman.&nbsp; After a little pause, she knelt down before the
picture of Our Lady of the Holy Heart, and spoke to her by all
the fanciful and poetic names of the Litany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Rose of Sharon!&nbsp; O Tower of David!&nbsp; O Star
of the Sea! have ye no comfort for my sore heart?&nbsp; Am I for
ever to hope?&nbsp; Grant me at least despair!&rdquo;&mdash;and
so on she went, heedless of my presence.&nbsp; Her prayers grew
wilder and wilder, till they seemed to me to touch on the borders
of madness and blasphemy.&nbsp; Almost involuntarily, I spoke as
if to stop her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any reason to think that your daughter is
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose from her knees, and came and stood before me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Fitzgerald is dead,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall never see her again in the flesh.&nbsp; No tongue
ever told me; but I know she is dead.&nbsp; I have yearned so to
see her, and my heart&rsquo;s will is fearful and strong: it
would have drawn her to me before now, if she had been a wanderer
on the other side of the world.&nbsp; I wonder often it has not
drawn her out of the grave to come and stand before me, and hear
me tell her how I loved her.&nbsp; For, sir, we parted
unfriends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew nothing but the dry particulars needed for my
lawyer&rsquo;s quest, but I could not help feeling for the
desolate woman; and she must have read the unusual sympathy with
her wistful eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, we did.&nbsp; She never knew how I loved her;
and we parted unfriends; and I fear me that I wished her voyage
might not turn out well, only meaning,&mdash;O, blessed Virgin!
you know I only meant that she should come home to her
mother&rsquo;s arms as to the happiest place on earth; but my
wishes are terrible&mdash;their power goes beyond my
thought&mdash;and there is no hope for me, if my words brought
Mary harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you do not know that she is
dead.&nbsp; Even now, you hoped she might be alive.&nbsp; Listen
to me,&rdquo; and I told her the tale I have already told you,
giving it all in the driest manner, for I wanted to recall the
clear sense that I felt almost sure she had possessed in her
younger days, and by keeping up her attention to details,
restrain the vague wildness of her grief.</p>
<p>She listened with deep attention, putting from time to time
such questions as convinced me I had to do with no common
intelligence, however dimmed and shorn by solitude and mysterious
sorrow.&nbsp; Then she took up her tale; and in few brief words,
told me of her wanderings abroad in vain search after her
daughter; sometimes in the wake of armies, sometimes in camp,
sometimes in city.&nbsp; The lady, whose waiting-woman Mary had
gone to be, had died soon after the date of her last letter home;
her husband, the foreign officer, had been serving in Hungary,
whither Bridget had followed him, but too late to find him.&nbsp;
Vague rumours reached her that Mary had made a great marriage:
and this sting of doubt was added,&mdash;whether the mother might
not be close to her child under her new name, and even hearing of
her every day; and yet never recognizing the lost one under the
appellation she then bore.&nbsp; At length the thought took
possession of her, that it was possible that all this time Mary
might be at home at Coldholme, in the Trough of Bolland, in
Lancashire, in England; and home came Bridget, in that vain hope,
to her desolate hearth, and empty cottage.&nbsp; Here she had
thought it safest to remain; if Mary was in life, it was here she
would seek for her mother.</p>
<p>I noted down one or two particulars out of Bridget&rsquo;s
narrative that I thought might be of use to me: for I was
stimulated to further search in a strange and extraordinary
manner.&nbsp; It seemed as if it were impressed upon me, that I
must take up the quest where Bridget had laid it down; and this
for no reason that had previously influenced me (such as my
uncle&rsquo;s anxiety on the subject, my own reputation as a
lawyer, and so on), but from some strange power which had taken
possession of my will only that very morning, and which forced it
in the direction it chose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will spare
nothing in the search.&nbsp; Trust to me.&nbsp; I will learn all
that can be learnt.&nbsp; You shall know all that money, or
pains, or wit can discover.&nbsp; It is true she may be long
dead: but she may have left a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child!&rdquo; she cried, as if for the first time
this idea had struck her mind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear him, Blessed
Virgin! he says she may have left a child.&nbsp; And you have
never told me, though I have prayed so for a sign, waking or
sleeping!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I know nothing but what you
tell me.&nbsp; You say you heard of her marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she caught nothing of what I said.&nbsp; She was praying
to the Virgin in a kind of ecstasy, which seemed to render her
unconscious of my very presence.</p>
<p>From Coldholme I went to Sir Philip Tempest&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The
wife of the foreign officer had been a cousin of his
father&rsquo;s, and from him I thought I might gain some
particulars as to the existence of the Count de la Tour
d&rsquo;Auvergne, and where I could find him; for I knew
questions <i>de vive voix</i> aid the flagging recollection, and
I was determined to lose no chance for want of trouble.&nbsp; But
Sir Philip had gone abroad, and it would be some time before I
could receive an answer.&nbsp; So I followed my uncle&rsquo;s
advice, to whom I had mentioned how wearied I felt, both in body
and mind, by my will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp search.&nbsp; He
immediately told me to go to Harrogate, there to await Sir
Philip&rsquo;s reply.&nbsp; I should be near to one of the places
connected with my search, Coldholme; not far from Sir Philip
Tempest, in case he returned, and I wished to ask him any further
questions; and, in conclusion, my uncle bade me try to forget all
about my business for a time.</p>
<p>This was far easier said than done.&nbsp; I have seen a child
on a common blown along by a high wind, without power of standing
still and resisting the tempestuous force.&nbsp; I was somewhat
in the same predicament as regarded my mental state.&nbsp;
Something resistless seemed to urge my thoughts on, through every
possible course by which there was a chance of attaining to my
object.&nbsp; I did not see the sweeping moors when I walked out:
when I held a book in my hand, and read the words, their sense
did not penetrate to my brain.&nbsp; If I slept, I went on with
the same ideas, always flowing in the same direction.&nbsp; This
could not last long without having a bad effect on the
body.&nbsp; I had an illness, which, although I was racked with
pain, was a positive relief to me, as it compelled me to live in
the present suffering, and not in the visionary researches I had
been continually making before.&nbsp; My kind uncle came to nurse
me; and after the immediate danger was over, my life seemed to
slip away in delicious languor for two or three months.&nbsp; I
did not ask&mdash;so much did I dread falling into the old
channel of thought&mdash;whether any reply had been received to
my letter to Sir Philip.&nbsp; I turned my whole imagination
right away from all that subject.&nbsp; My uncle remained with me
until nigh midsummer, and then returned to his business in
London; leaving me perfectly well, although not completely
strong.&nbsp; I was to follow him in a fortnight; when, as he
said, &ldquo;we would look over letters, and talk about several
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew what this little speech alluded to,
and shrank from the train of thought it suggested, which was so
intimately connected with my first feelings of illness.&nbsp;
However, I had a fortnight more to roam on those invigorating
Yorkshire moors.</p>
<p>In those days, there was one large, rambling inn, at
Harrogate, close to the Medicinal Spring; but it was already
becoming too small for the accommodation of the influx of
visitors, and many lodged round about, in the farm-houses of the
district.&nbsp; It was so early in the season, that I had the inn
pretty much to myself; and, indeed, felt rather like a visitor in
a private house, so intimate had the landlord and landlady become
with me during my long illness.&nbsp; She would chide me for
being out so late on the moors, or for having been too long
without food, quite in a motherly way; while he consulted me
about vintages and wines, and taught me many a Yorkshire wrinkle
about horses.&nbsp; In my walks I met other strangers from time
to time.&nbsp; Even before my uncle had left me, I had noticed,
with half-torpid curiosity, a young lady of very striking
appearance, who went about always accompanied by an elderly
companion,&mdash;hardly a gentlewoman, but with something in her
look that prepossessed me in her favour.&nbsp; The younger lady
always put her veil down when any one approached; so it had been
only once or twice, when I had come upon her at a sudden turn in
the path, that I had even had a glimpse at her face.&nbsp; I am
not sure if it was beautiful, though in after-life I grew to
think it so.&nbsp; But it was at this time overshadowed by a
sadness that never varied: a pale, quiet, resigned look of
intense suffering, that irresistibly attracted me,&mdash;not with
love, but with a sense of infinite compassion for one so young
yet so hopelessly unhappy.&nbsp; The companion wore something of
the same look: quiet melancholy, hopeless, yet resigned.&nbsp; I
asked my landlord who they were.&nbsp; He said they were called
Clarke, and wished to be considered as mother and daughter; but
that, for his part, he did not believe that to be their right
name, or that there was any such relationship between them.&nbsp;
They had been in the neighbourhood of Harrogate for some time,
lodging in a remote farm-house.&nbsp; The people there would tell
nothing about them; saying that they paid handsomely, and never
did any harm; so why should they be speaking of any strange
things that might happen?&nbsp; That, as the landlord shrewdly
observed, showed there was something out of the common way he had
heard that the elderly woman was a cousin of the farmer&rsquo;s
where they lodged, and so the regard existing between relations
might help to keep them quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he think, then, was the reason for their
extreme seclusion?&rdquo; asked I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, he could not tell,&mdash;not he.&nbsp; He had
heard that the young lady, for all as quiet as she seemed, played
strange pranks at times.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shook his head when I
asked him for more particulars, and refused to give them, which
made me doubt if he knew any, for he was in general a talkative
and communicative man.&nbsp; In default of other interests, after
my uncle left, I set myself to watch these two people.&nbsp; I
hovered about their walks drawn towards them with a strange
fascination, which was not diminished by their evident annoyance
at so frequently meeting me.&nbsp; One day, I had the sudden good
fortune to be at hand when they were alarmed by the attack of a
bull, which, in those unenclosed grazing districts, was a
particularly dangerous occurrence.&nbsp; I have other and more
important things to relate, than to tell of the accident which
gave me an opportunity of rescuing them, it is enough to say,
that this event was the beginning of an acquaintance, reluctantly
acquiesced in by them, but eagerly prosecuted by me.&nbsp; I can
hardly tell when intense curiosity became merged in love, but in
less than ten days after my uncle&rsquo;s departure I was
passionately enamoured of Mistress Lucy, as her attendant called
her; carefully&mdash;for this I noted well&mdash;avoiding any
address which appeared as if there was an equality of station
between them.&nbsp; I noticed also that Mrs. Clarke, the elderly
woman, after her first reluctance to allow me to pay them any
attentions had been overcome, was cheered by my evident
attachment to the young girl; it seemed to lighten her heavy
burden of care, and she evidently favoured my visits to the
farmhouse where they lodged.&nbsp; It was not so with Lucy.&nbsp;
A more attractive person I never saw, in spite of her depression
of manner, and shrinking avoidance of me.&nbsp; I felt sure at
once, that whatever was the source of her grief, it rose from no
fault of her own.&nbsp; It was difficult to draw her into
conversation; but when at times, for a moment or two, I beguiled
her into talk, I could see a rare intelligence in her face, and a
grave, trusting look in the soft, gray eyes that were raised for
a minute to mine.&nbsp; I made every excuse I possibly could for
going there.&nbsp; I sought wild flowers for Lucy&rsquo;s sake; I
planned walks for Lucy&rsquo;s sake; I watched the heavens by
night, in hopes that some unusual beauty of sky would justify me
in tempting Mrs. Clarke and Lucy forth upon the moors, to gaze at
the great purple dome above.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that Lucy was aware of my love; but that, for
some motive which I could not guess, she would fain have repelled
me; but then again I saw, or fancied I saw, that her heart spoke
in my favour, and that there was a struggle going on in her mind,
which at times (I loved so dearly) I could have begged her to
spare herself, even though the happiness of my whole life should
have been the sacrifice; for her complexion grew paler, her
aspect of sorrow more hopeless, her delicate frame yet
slighter.&nbsp; During this period I had written, I should say,
to my uncle, to beg to be allowed to prolong my stay at
Harrogate, not giving any reason; but such was his tenderness
towards me, that in a few days I heard from him, giving me a
willing permission, and only charging me to take care of myself,
and not use too much exertion during the hot weather.</p>
<p>One sultry evening I drew near the farm.&nbsp; The windows of
their parlour were open, and I heard voices when I turned the
corner of the house, as I passed the first window (there were two
windows in their little ground-floor room).&nbsp; I saw Lucy
distinctly; but when I had knocked at their door&mdash;the
house-door stood always ajar&mdash;she was gone, and I saw only
Mrs. Clarke, turning over the work-things lying on the table, in
a nervous and purposeless manner.&nbsp; I felt by instinct that a
conversation of some importance was coming on, in which I should
be expected to say what was my object in paying these frequent
visits.&nbsp; I was glad of the opportunity.&nbsp; My uncle had
several times alluded to the pleasant possibility of my bringing
home a young wife, to cheer and adorn the old house in Ormond
Street.&nbsp; He was rich, and I was to succeed him, and had, as
I knew, a fair reputation for so young a lawyer.&nbsp; So on my
side I saw no obstacle.&nbsp; It was true that Lucy was shrouded
in mystery; her name (I was convinced it was not Clarke), birth,
parentage, and previous life were unknown to me.&nbsp; But I was
sure of her goodness and sweet innocence, and although I knew
that there must be something painful to be told, to account for
her mournful sadness, yet I was willing to bear my share in her
grief, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>Mrs. Clarke began, as if it was a relief to her to plunge into
the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have thought, sir&mdash;at least I have
thought&mdash;that you knew very little of us, nor we of you,
indeed; not enough to warrant the intimate acquaintance we have
fallen into.&nbsp; I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; she went on,
nervously; &ldquo;I am but a plain kind of woman, and I mean to
use no rudeness; but I must say straight out that
I&mdash;we&mdash;think it would be better for you not to come so
often to see us.&nbsp; She is very unprotected,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I not come to see you, dear madam?&rdquo;
asked I, eagerly, glad of the opportunity of explaining
myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I come, I own, because I have learnt to love
Mistress Lucy, and wish to teach her to love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mistress Clarke shook her head, and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, sir&mdash;neither love her, nor, for the
sake of all you hold sacred, teach her to love you!&nbsp; If I am
too late, and you love her already, forget her,&mdash;forget
these last few weeks.&nbsp; O!&nbsp; I should never have allowed
you to come!&rdquo; she went on passionately; &ldquo;but what am
I to do?&nbsp; We are forsaken by all, except the great God, and
even He permits a strange and evil power to afflict us&mdash;what
am I to do!&nbsp; Where is it to end?&rdquo; She wrung her hands
in her distress; then she turned to me: &ldquo;Go away, sir! go
away, before you learn to care any more for her.&nbsp; I ask it
for your own sake&mdash;I implore!&nbsp; You have been good and
kind to us, and we shall always recollect you with gratitude; but
go away now, and never come back to cross our fatal
path!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, madam,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I shall do no such
thing.&nbsp; You urge it for my own sake.&nbsp; I have no fear,
so urged&mdash;nor wish, except to hear more&mdash;all.&nbsp; I
cannot have seen Mistress Lucy in all the intimacy of this last
fortnight, without acknowledging her goodness and innocence; and
without seeing&mdash;pardon me, madam&mdash;that for some reason
you are two very lonely women, in some mysterious sorrow and
distress.&nbsp; Now, though I am not powerful myself, yet I have
friends who are so wise and kind that they may be said to possess
power.&nbsp; Tell me some particulars.&nbsp; Why are you in
grief&mdash;what is your secret&mdash;why are you here?&nbsp; I
declare solemnly that nothing you have said has daunted me in my
wish to become Lucy&rsquo;s husband; nor will I shrink from any
difficulty that, as such an aspirant, I may have to
encounter.&nbsp; You say you are friendless&mdash;why cast away
an honest friend?&nbsp; I will tell you of people to whom you may
write, and who will answer any questions as to my character and
prospects.&nbsp; I do not shun inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better go away,
sir.&nbsp; You know nothing about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know your names,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and I have
heard you allude to the part of the country from which you came,
which I happen to know as a wild and lonely place.&nbsp; There
are so few people living in it that, if I chose to go there, I
could easily ascertain all about you; but I would rather hear it
from yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; You see I wanted to pique her into
telling me something definite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know our true names, sir,&rdquo; said she,
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I may have conjectured as much.&nbsp; But tell
me, then, I conjure you.&nbsp; Give me your reasons for
distrusting my willingness to stand by what I have said with
regard to Mistress Lucy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what can I do?&rdquo; exclaimed she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I am turning away a true friend, as he
says?&mdash;Stay!&rdquo; coming to a sudden
decision&mdash;&ldquo;I will tell you something&mdash;I cannot
tell you all&mdash;you would not believe it.&nbsp; But, perhaps,
I can tell you enough to prevent your going on in your hopeless
attachment.&nbsp; I am not Lucy&rsquo;s mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I conjectured,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not even know whether she is the legitimate or
illegitimate child of her father.&nbsp; But he is cruelly turned
against her; and her mother is long dead; and for a terrible
reason, she has no other creature to keep constant to her but
me.&nbsp; She&mdash;only two years ago&mdash;such a darling and
such a pride in her father&rsquo;s house!&nbsp; Why, sir, there
is a mystery that might happen in connection with her any moment;
and then you would go away like all the rest; and, when you next
heard her name, you would loathe her.&nbsp; Others, who have
loved her longer, have done so before now.&nbsp; My poor child!
whom neither God nor man has mercy upon&mdash;or, surely, she
would die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The good woman was stopped by her crying.&nbsp; I confess, I
was a little stunned by her last words; but only for a
moment.&nbsp; At any rate, till I knew definitely what was this
mysterious stain upon one so simple and pure, as Lucy seemed, I
would not desert her, and so I said; and she made me
answer:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are daring in your heart to think harm of my
child, sir, after knowing her as you have done, you are no good
man yourself; but I am so foolish and helpless in my great
sorrow, that I would fain hope to find a friend in you.&nbsp; I
cannot help trusting that, although you may no longer feel toward
her as a lover, you will have pity upon us; and perhaps, by your
learning you can tell us where to go for aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I implore you to tell me what this mystery is,&rdquo; I
cried, almost maddened by this suspense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said she, solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
under a deep vow of secrecy.&nbsp; If you are to be told, it must
be by her.&rdquo;&nbsp; She left the room, and I remained to
ponder over this strange interview.&nbsp; I mechanically turned
over the few books, and with eyes that saw nothing at the time,
examined the tokens of Lucy&rsquo;s frequent presence in that
room.</p>
<p>When I got home at night, I remembered how all these trifles
spoke of a pure and tender heart and innocent life.&nbsp;
Mistress Clarke returned; she had been crying sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is as I feared: she
loves you so much that she is willing to run the fearful risk of
telling you all herself&mdash;she acknowledges it is but a poor
chance; but your sympathy will be a balm, if you give it.&nbsp;
To-morrow, come here at ten in the morning; and, as you hope for
pity in your hour of agony, repress all show of fear or
repugnance you may feel towards one so grievously
afflicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I half smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
It seemed too absurd to imagine my feeling dislike to Lucy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her father loved her well,&rdquo; said she, gravely,
&ldquo;yet he drove her out like some monstrous thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at this moment came a peal of ringing laughter from the
garden.&nbsp; It was Lucy&rsquo;s voice; it sounded as if she
were standing just on one side of the open casement&mdash;and as
though she were suddenly stirred to merriment&mdash;merriment
verging on boisterousness, by the doings or sayings of some other
person.&nbsp; I can scarcely say why, but the sound jarred on me
inexpressibly.&nbsp; She knew the subject of our conversation,
and must have been at least aware of the state of agitation her
friend was in; she herself usually so gentle and quiet.&nbsp; I
half rose to go to the window, and satisfy my instinctive
curiosity as to what had provoked this burst of, ill-timed
laughter; but Mrs. Clarke threw her whole weight and power upon
the hand with which she pressed and kept me down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; she said, white and
trembling all over, &ldquo;sit still; be quiet.&nbsp; Oh! be
patient.&nbsp; To-morrow you will know all.&nbsp; Leave us, for
we are all sorely afflicted.&nbsp; Do not seek to know more about
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again that laugh&mdash;so musical in sound, yet so discordant
to my heart.&nbsp; She held me tight&mdash;tighter; without
positive violence I could not have risen.&nbsp; I was sitting
with my back to the window, but I felt a shadow pass between the
sun&rsquo;s warmth and me, and a strange shudder ran through my
frame.&nbsp; In a minute or two she released me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; repeated she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be warned, I ask
you once more.&nbsp; I do not think you can stand this knowledge
that you seek.&nbsp; If I had had my own way, Lucy should never
have yielded, and promised to tell you all.&nbsp; Who knows what
may come of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am firm in my wish to know all.&nbsp; I return at ten
to-morrow morning, and then expect to see Mistress Lucy
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned away; having my own suspicions, I confess, as to
Mistress Clarke&rsquo;s sanity.</p>
<p>Conjectures as to the meaning of her hints, and uncomfortable
thoughts connected with that strange laughter, filled my
mind.&nbsp; I could hardly sleep.&nbsp; I rose early; and long
before the hour I had appointed, I was on the path over the
common that led to the old farm-house where they lodged.&nbsp; I
suppose that Lucy had passed no better a night than I; for there
she was also, slowly pacing with her even step, her eyes bent
down, her whole look most saintly and pure.&nbsp; She started
when I came close to her, and grew paler as I reminded her of my
appointment, and spoke with something of the impatience of
obstacles that, seeing her once more, had called up afresh in my
mind.&nbsp; All strange and terrible hints, and giddy merriment
were forgotten.&nbsp; My heart gave forth words of fire, and my
tongue uttered them.&nbsp; Her colour went and came, as she
listened; but, when I had ended my passionate speeches, she
lifted her soft eyes to me, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know that you have something to learn about me
yet.&nbsp; I only want to say this: I shall not think less of
you&mdash;less well of you, I mean&mdash;if you, too, fall away
from me when you know all.&nbsp; Stop!&rdquo; said she, as if
fearing another burst of mad words.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen to
me.&nbsp; My father is a man of great wealth.&nbsp; I never knew
my mother; she must have died when I was very young.&nbsp; When
first I remember anything, I was living in a great, lonely house,
with my dear and faithful Mistress Clarke.&nbsp; My father, even,
was not there; he was&mdash;he is&mdash;a soldier, and his duties
lie aboard.&nbsp; But he came from time to time, and every time I
think he loved me more and more.&nbsp; He brought me rarities
from foreign lands, which prove to me now how much he must have
thought of me during his absences.&nbsp; I can sit down and
measure the depth of his lost love now, by such standards as
these.&nbsp; I never thought whether he loved me or not, then; it
was so natural, that it was like the air I breathed.&nbsp; Yet he
was an angry man at times, even then; but never with me.&nbsp; He
was very reckless, too; and, once or twice, I heard a whisper
among the servants that a doom was over him, and that he knew it,
and tried to drown his knowledge in wild activity, and even
sometimes, sir, in wine.&nbsp; So I grew up in this grand
mansion, in that lonely place.&nbsp; Everything around me seemed
at my disposal, and I think every one loved me; I am sure I loved
them.&nbsp; Till about two years ago&mdash;I remember it
well&mdash;my father had come to England, to us; and he seemed so
proud and so pleased with me and all I had done.&nbsp; And one
day his tongue seemed loosened with wine, and he told me much
that I had not known till then,&mdash;how dearly he had loved my
mother, yet how his wilful usage had caused her death; and then
he went on to say how he loved me better than any creature on
earth, and how, some day, he hoped to take me to foreign places,
for that he could hardly bear these long absences from his only
child.&nbsp; Then he seemed to change suddenly, and said, in a
strange, wild way, that I was not to believe what he said; that
there was many a thing he loved better&mdash;his horse&mdash;his
dog&mdash;I know not what.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And &rsquo;twas only the next morning that, when I came
into his room to ask his blessing as was my wont, he received me
with fierce and angry words.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why had I,&rsquo; so he
asked, &lsquo;been delighting myself in such wanton
mischief&mdash;dancing over the tender plants in the flower-beds,
all set with the famous Dutch bulbs he had brought from
Holland?&rsquo; I had never been out of doors that morning, sir,
and I could not conceive what he meant, and so I said; and then
he swore at me for a liar, and said I was of no true blood, for
he had seen me doing all that mischief himself&mdash;with his own
eyes.&nbsp; What could I say?&nbsp; He would not listen to me,
and even my tears seemed only to irritate him.&nbsp; That day was
the beginning of my great sorrows.&nbsp; Not long after, he
reproached me for my undue familiarity&mdash;all unbecoming a
gentlewoman&mdash;with his grooms.&nbsp; I had been in the
stable-yard, laughing and talking, he said.&nbsp; Now, sir, I am
something of a coward by nature, and I had always dreaded horses;
be-sides that, my father&rsquo;s servants&mdash;those whom he
brought with him from foreign parts&mdash;were wild fellows, whom
I had always avoided, and to whom I had never spoken, except as a
lady must needs from time to time speak to her father&rsquo;s
people.&nbsp; Yet my father called me by names of which I hardly
know the meaning, but my heart told me they were such as shame
any modest woman; and from that day he turned quite against
me;&mdash;nay, sir, not many weeks after that, he came in with a
riding-whip in his hand; and, accusing me harshly of evil doings,
of which I knew no more than you, sir, he was about to strike me,
and I, all in bewildering tears, was ready to take his stripes as
great kindness compared to his harder words, when suddenly he
stopped his arm mid-way, gasped and staggered, crying out,
&lsquo;The curse&mdash;the curse!&rsquo;&nbsp; I looked up in
terror.&nbsp; In the great mirror opposite I saw myself, and
right behind, another wicked, fearful self, so like me that my
soul seemed to quiver within me, as though not knowing to which
similitude of body it belonged.&nbsp; My father saw my double at
the same moment, either in its dreadful reality, whatever that
might be, or in the scarcely less terrible reflection in the
mirror; but what came of it at that moment I cannot say, for I
suddenly swooned away; and when I came to myself I was lying in
my bed, and my faithful Clarke sitting by me.&nbsp; I was in my
bed for days; and even while I lay there my double was seen by
all, flitting about the house and gardens, always about some
mischievous or detestable work.&nbsp; What wonder that every one
shrank from me in dread&mdash;that my father drove me forth at
length, when the disgrace of which I was the cause was past his
patience to bear.&nbsp; Mistress Clarke came with me; and here we
try to live such a life of piety and prayer as may in time set me
free from the curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the time she had been speaking, I had been weighing her
story in my mind.&nbsp; I had hitherto put cases of witchcraft on
one side, as mere superstitions; and my uncle and I had had many
an argument, he supporting himself by the opinion of his good
friend Sir Matthew Hale.&nbsp; Yet this sounded like the tale of
one bewitched; or was it merely the effect of a life of extreme
seclusion telling on the nerves of a sensitive girl?&nbsp; My
scepticism inclined me to the latter belief, and when she paused
I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy that some physician could have disabused your
father of his belief in visions&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just at that instant, standing as I was opposite to her in the
full and perfect morning light, I saw behind her another
figure&mdash;a ghastly resemblance, complete in likeness, so far
as form and feature and minutest touch of dress could go, but
with a loathsome demon soul looking out of the gray eyes, that
were in turns mocking and voluptuous.&nbsp; My heart stood still
within me; every hair rose up erect; my flesh crept with
horror.&nbsp; I could not see the grave and tender Lucy&mdash;my
eyes were fascinated by the creature beyond.&nbsp; I know not
why, but I put out my hand to clutch it; I grasped nothing but
empty air, and my whole blood curdled to ice.&nbsp; For a moment
I could not see; then my sight came back, and I saw Lucy standing
before me, alone, deathly pale, and, I could have fancied,
almost, shrunk in size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> has been near me?&rdquo;
she said, as if asking a question.</p>
<p>The sound seemed taken out of her voice; it was husky as the
notes on an old harpsichord when the strings have ceased to
vibrate.&nbsp; She read her answer in my face, I suppose, for I
could not speak.&nbsp; Her look was one of intense fear, but that
died away into an aspect of most humble patience.&nbsp; At length
she seemed to force herself to face behind and around her: she
saw the purple moors, the blue distant hills, quivering in the
sunlight, but nothing else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take me home?&rdquo; she said, meekly.</p>
<p>I took her by the hand, and led her silently through the
budding heather&mdash;we dared not speak; for we could not tell
but that the dread creature was listening, although
unseen,&mdash;but that <span class="GutSmall">IT</span> might
appear and push us asunder.&nbsp; I never loved her more fondly
than now when&mdash;and that was the unspeakable misery&mdash;the
idea of her was becoming so inextricably blended with the
shuddering thought of <span class="GutSmall">IT</span>.&nbsp; She
seemed to understand what I must be feeling.&nbsp; She let go my
hand, which she had kept clasped until then, when we reached the
garden gate, and went forwards to meet her anxious friend, who
was standing by the window looking for her.&nbsp; I could not
enter the house: I needed silence, society, leisure,
change&mdash;I knew not what&mdash;to shake off the sensation of
that creature&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; Yet I lingered about the
garden&mdash;I hardly know why; I partly suppose, because I
feared to encounter the resemblance again on the solitary common,
where it had vanished, and partly from a feeling of inexpressible
compassion for Lucy.&nbsp; In a few minutes Mistress Clarke came
forth and joined me.&nbsp; We walked some paces in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know all now,&rdquo; said she, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw <span class="GutSmall">IT</span>,&rdquo; said I,
below my breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shrink from us, now,&rdquo; she said, with a
hopelessness which stirred up all that was brave or good in
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a whit,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Human flesh
shrinks from encounter with the powers of darkness: and, for some
reason unknown to me, the pure and holy Lucy is their
victim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the
children,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is her father?&rdquo; asked I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knowing
as much as I do, I may surely know more&mdash;know all.&nbsp;
Tell me, I entreat you, madam, all that you can conjecture
respecting this demoniac persecution of one so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will; but not now.&nbsp; I must go to Lucy now.&nbsp;
Come this afternoon, I will see you alone; and oh, sir!&nbsp; I
will trust that you may yet find some way to help us in our sore
trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was miserably exhausted by the swooning affright which had
taken possession of me.&nbsp; When I reached the inn, I staggered
in like one overcome by wine.&nbsp; I went to my own private
room.&nbsp; It was some time before I saw that the weekly post
had come in, and brought me my letters.&nbsp; There was one from
my uncle, one from my home in Devonshire, and one, re-directed
over the first address, sealed with a great coat of arms, It was
from Sir Philip Tempest: my letter of inquiry respecting Mary
Fitzgerald had reached him at Li&eacute;ge, where it so happened
that the Count de la Tour d&rsquo;Auvergne was quartered at the
very time.&nbsp; He remembered his wife&rsquo;s beautiful
attendant; she had had high words with the deceased countess,
respecting her intercourse with an English gentleman of good
standing, who was also in the foreign service.&nbsp; The countess
augured evil of his intentions; while Mary, proud and vehement,
asserted that he would soon marry her, and resented her
mistress&rsquo;s warnings as an insult.&nbsp; The consequence
was, that she had left Madame de la Tour d&rsquo;Auvergne&rsquo;s
service, and, as the Count believed, had gone to live with the
Englishman; whether he had married her, or not, he could not
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; added Sir Philip Tempest,
&ldquo;you may easily hear what particulars you wish to know
respecting Mary Fitzgerald from the Englishman himself, if, as I
suspect, he is no other than my neighbour and former
acquaintance, Mr. Gisborne, of Skipford Hall, in the West
Riding.&nbsp; I am led to the belief that he is no other, by
several small particulars, none of which are in themselves
conclusive, but which, taken together, furnish a mass of
presumptive evidence.&nbsp; As far as I could make out from the
Count&rsquo;s foreign pronunciation, Gisborne was the name of the
Englishman: I know that Gisborne of Skipford was abroad and in
the foreign service at that time&mdash;he was a likely fellow
enough for such an exploit, and, above all, certain expressions
recur to my mind which he used in reference to old Bridget
Fitzgerald, of Coldholme, whom he once encountered while staying
with me at Starkey Manor-house.&nbsp; I remember that the meeting
seemed to have produced some extraordinary effect upon his mind,
as though he had suddenly discovered some connection which she
might have had with his previous life.&nbsp; I beg you to let me
know if I can be of any further service to you.&nbsp; Your uncle
once rendered me a good turn, and I will gladly repay it, so far
as in me lies, to his nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was now apparently close on the discovery which I had
striven so many months to attain.&nbsp; But success had lost its
zest.&nbsp; I put my letters down, and seemed to forget them all
in thinking of the morning I had passed that very day.&nbsp;
Nothing was real but the unreal presence, which had come like an
evil blast across my bodily eyes, and burnt itself down upon my
brain.&nbsp; Dinner came, and went away untouched.&nbsp; Early in
the afternoon I walked to the farm-house.&nbsp; I found Mistress
Clarke alone, and I was glad and relieved.&nbsp; She was
evidently prepared to tell me all I might wish to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked me for Mistress Lucy&rsquo;s true name; it is
Gisborne,&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Gisborne of Skipford?&rdquo; I exclaimed,
breathless with anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same,&rdquo; said she, quietly, not regarding my
manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her father is a man of note; although, being
a Roman Catholic, he cannot take that rank in this country to
which his station entitles him.&nbsp; The consequence is that he
lives much abroad&mdash;has been a soldier, I am told.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lucy&rsquo;s mother?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never knew her,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lucy was about three years old when I was
engaged to take charge of her.&nbsp; Her mother was
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know her name?&mdash;you can tell if it was
Mary Fitzgerald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked astonished.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was her name.&nbsp;
But, sir, how came you to be so well acquainted with it?&nbsp; It
was a mystery to the whole household at Skipford Court.&nbsp; She
was some beautiful young woman whom he lured away from her
protectors while he was abroad.&nbsp; I have heard said he
practised some terrible deceit upon her, and when she came to
know it, she was neither to have nor to hold, but rushed off from
his very arms, and threw herself into a rapid stream and was
drowned.&nbsp; It stung him deep with remorse, but I used to
think the remembrance of the mother&rsquo;s cruel death made him
love the child yet dearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her, as briefly as might be, of my researches after the
descendant and heir of the Fitzgeralds of Kildoon, and
added&mdash;something of my old lawyer spirit returning into me
for the moment&mdash;that I had no doubt but that we should prove
Lucy to be by right possessed of large estates in Ireland.</p>
<p>No flush came over her gray face; no light into her
eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what is all the wealth in the whole world
to that poor girl?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will not free
her from the ghastly bewitchment which persecutes her.&nbsp; As
for money, what a pitiful thing it is! it cannot touch
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more can the Evil Creature harm her,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her holy nature dwells apart, and cannot be
defiled or stained by all the devilish arts in the whole
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True! but it is a cruel fate to know that all shrink
from her, sooner or later, as from one
possessed&mdash;accursed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came it to pass?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I know not.&nbsp; Old rumours there are, that were
bruited through the household at Skipford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They came from servants, who would fain account for
every thing.&nbsp; They say that, many years ago, Mr. Gisborne
killed a dog belonging to an old witch at Coldholme; that she
cursed, with a dreadful and mysterious curse, the creature,
whatever it might be, that he should love best; and that it
struck so deeply into his heart that for years he kept himself
aloof from any temptation to love aught.&nbsp; But who could help
loving Lucy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never heard the witch&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; I
gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;they called her Bridget: they said he would
never go near the spot again for terror of her.&nbsp; Yet he was
a brave man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said I, taking hold of her arm, the
better to arrest her full attention: &ldquo;if what I suspect
holds true, that man stole Bridget&rsquo;s only child&mdash;the
very Mary Fitzgerald who was Lucy&rsquo;s mother; if so, Bridget
cursed him in ignorance of the deeper wrong he had done
her.&nbsp; To this hour she yearns after her lost child, and
questions the saints whether she be living or not.&nbsp; The
roots of that curse lie deeper than she knows: she unwittingly
banned him for a deeper guilt than that of killing a dumb
beast.&nbsp; The sins of the fathers are indeed visited upon the
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Mistress Clarke, eagerly, &ldquo;she
would never let evil rest on her own grandchild?&nbsp; Surely,
sir, if what you say be true, there are hopes for Lucy.&nbsp; Let
us go&mdash;go at once, and tell this fearful woman all that you
suspect, and beseech her to take off the spell she has put upon
her innocent grandchild.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to me, indeed, that something like this was the best
course we could pursue.&nbsp; But first it was necessary to
ascertain more than what mere rumour or careless hearsay could
tell.&nbsp; My thoughts turned to my uncle&mdash;he could advise
me wisely&mdash;he ought to know all.&nbsp; I resolved to go to
him without delay; but I did not choose to tell Mistress Clarke
of all the visionary plans that flitted through my mind.&nbsp; I
simply declared my intention of proceeding straight to London on
Lucy&rsquo;s affairs.&nbsp; I bade her believe that my interest
on the young lady&rsquo;s behalf was greater than ever, and that
my whole time should be given up to her cause.&nbsp; I saw that
Mistress Clarke distrusted me, because my mind was too full of
thoughts for my words to flow freely.&nbsp; She sighed and shook
her head, and said, &ldquo;Well, it is all right!&rdquo; in such
a tone that it was an implied reproach.&nbsp; But I was firm and
constant in my heart, and I took confidence from that.</p>
<p>I rode to London.&nbsp; I rode long days drawn out into the
lovely summer nights: I could not rest.&nbsp; I reached
London.&nbsp; I told my uncle all, though in the stir of the
great city the horror had faded away, and I could hardly imagine
that he would believe the account I gave him of the fearful
double of Lucy which I had seen on the lonely moor-side.&nbsp;
But my uncle had lived many years, and learnt many things; and,
in the deep secrets of family history that had been confided to
him, he had heard of cases of innocent people bewitched and taken
possession of by evil spirits yet more fearful than
Lucy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For, as he said, to judge from all I told
him, that resemblance had no power over her&mdash;she was too
pure and good to be tainted by its evil, haunting presence.&nbsp;
It had, in all probability, so my uncle conceived, tried to
suggest wicked thoughts and to tempt to wicked actions but she,
in her saintly maidenhood, had passed on undefiled by evil
thought or deed.&nbsp; It could not touch her soul: but true, it
set her apart from all sweet love or common human
intercourse.&nbsp; My uncle threw himself with an energy more
like six-and-twenty than sixty into the consideration of the
whole case.&nbsp; He undertook the proving Lucy&rsquo;s descent,
and volunteered to go and find out Mr. Gisborne, and obtain,
firstly, the legal proofs of her descent from the Fitzgeralds of
Kildoon, and, secondly, to try and hear all that he could
respecting the working of the curse, and whether any and what
means had been taken to exorcise that terrible appearance.&nbsp;
For he told me of instances where, by prayers and long fasting,
the evil possessor had been driven forth with howling and many
cries from the body which it had come to inhabit; he spoke of
those strange New England cases which had happened not so long
before; of Mr. Defoe, who had written a book, wherein he had
named many modes of subduing apparitions, and sending them back
whence they came; and, lastly, he spoke low of dreadful ways of
compelling witches to undo their witchcraft.&nbsp; But I could
not endure to hear of those tortures and burnings.&nbsp; I said
that Bridget was rather a wild and savage woman than a malignant
witch; and, above all, that Lucy was of her kith and kin; and
that, in putting her to the trial, by water or by fire, we should
be torturing&mdash;it might be to the death&mdash;the ancestress
of her we sought to redeem.</p>
<p>My uncle thought awhile, and then said, that in this last
matter I was right&mdash;at any rate, it should not be tried,
with his consent, till all other modes of remedy had failed; and
he assented to my proposal that I should go myself and see
Bridget, and tell her all.</p>
<p>In accordance with this, I went down once more to the wayside
inn near Coldholme.&nbsp; It was late at night when I arrived
there; and, while I supped, I inquired of the landlord more
particulars as to Bridget&rsquo;s ways.&nbsp; Solitary and savage
had been her life for many years.&nbsp; Wild and despotic were
her words and manner to those few people who came across her
path.&nbsp; The country-folk did her imperious bidding, because
they feared to disobey.&nbsp; If they pleased her, they
prospered; if, on the contrary, they neglected or traversed her
behests, misfortune, small or great, fell on them and
theirs.&nbsp; It was not detestation so much as an indefinable
terror that she excited.</p>
<p>In the morning I went to see her.&nbsp; She was standing on
the green outside her cottage, and received me with the sullen
grandeur of a throneless queen.&nbsp; I read in her face that she
recognized me, and that I was not unwelcome; but she stood silent
till I had opened my errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have news of your daughter,&rdquo; said I, resolved
to speak straight to all that I knew she felt of love, and not to
spare her.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stern figure scarcely trembled, but her hand sought the
support of the door-post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that she was dead,&rdquo; said she, deep and
low, and then was silent for an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;My tears
that should have flowed for her were burnt up long years
ago.&nbsp; Young man, tell me about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said I, having a strange power given me
of confronting one, whom, nevertheless, in my secret soul I
dreaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had once a little dog,&rdquo; I continued.&nbsp;
The words called out in her more show of emotion than the
intelligence of her daughter&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; She broke in
upon my speech:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had!&nbsp; It was hers&mdash;the last thing I had of
hers&mdash;and it was shot for wantonness!&nbsp; It died in my
arms.&nbsp; The man who killed that dog rues it to this
day.&nbsp; For that dumb beast&rsquo;s blood, his best-beloved
stands accursed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes distended, as if she were in a trance and saw the
working of her curse.&nbsp; Again I spoke:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, woman!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that best-beloved,
standing accursed before men, is your dead daughter&rsquo;s
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The life, the energy, the passion, came back to the eyes with
which she pierced through me, to see if I spoke truth; then,
without another question or word, she threw herself on the ground
with fearful vehemence, and clutched at the innocent daisies with
convulsed hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bone of my bone! flesh of my flesh! have I cursed
thee&mdash;and art thou accursed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she moaned, as she lay prostrate in her great agony.&nbsp;
I stood aghast at my own work.&nbsp; She did not hear my broken
sentences; she asked no more, but the dumb confirmation which my
sad looks had given that one fact, that her curse rested on her
own daughter&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; The fear grew on me lest she
should die in her strife of body and soul; and then might not
Lucy remain under the spell as long as she lived?</p>
<p>Even at this moment, I saw Lucy coming through the woodland
path that led to Bridget&rsquo;s cottage; Mistress Clarke was
with her: I felt at my heart that it was she, by the balmy peace
which the look of her sent over me, as she slowly advanced, a
glad surprise shining out of her soft quiet eyes.&nbsp; That was
as her gaze met mine.&nbsp; As her looks fell on the woman lying
stiff, convulsed on the earth, they became full of tender pity;
and she came forward to try and lift her up.&nbsp; Seating
herself on the turf, she took Bridget&rsquo;s head into her lap;
and, with gentle touches, she arranged the dishevelled gray hair
streaming thick and wild from beneath her mutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help her!&rdquo; murmured Lucy.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
she suffers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At her desire we sought for water; but when we returned,
Bridget had recovered her wandering senses, and was kneeling with
clasped hands before Lucy, gazing at that sweet sad face as
though her troubled nature drank in health and peace from every
moment&rsquo;s contemplation.&nbsp; A faint tinge on Lucy&rsquo;s
pale cheeks showed me that she was aware of our return; otherwise
it appeared as if she was conscious of her influence for good
over the passionate and troubled woman kneeling before her, and
would not willingly avert her grave and loving eyes from that
wrinkled and careworn countenance.</p>
<p>Suddenly&mdash;in the twinkling of an eye&mdash;the creature
appeared, there, behind Lucy; fearfully the same as to outward
semblance, but kneeling exactly as Bridget knelt, and clasping
her hands in jesting mimicry as Bridget clasped hers in her
ecstasy that was deepening into a prayer.&nbsp; Mistress Clarke
cried out&mdash;Bridget arose slowly, her gaze fixed on the
creature beyond: drawing her breath with a hissing sound, never
moving her terrible eyes, that were steady as stone, she made a
dart at the phantom, and caught, as I had done, a mere handful of
empty air.&nbsp; We saw no more of the creature&mdash;it vanished
as suddenly as it came, but Bridget looked slowly on, as if
watching some receding form.&nbsp; Lucy sat still, white,
trembling, drooping&mdash;I think she would have swooned if I had
not been there to uphold her.&nbsp; While I was attending to her,
Bridget passed us, without a word to any one, and, entering her
cottage, she barred herself in, and left us without.</p>
<p>All our endeavours were now directed to get Lucy back to the
house where she had tarried the night before.&nbsp; Mistress
Clarke told me that, not hearing from me (some letter must have
miscarried), she had grown impatient and despairing, and had
urged Lucy to the enterprise of coming to seek her grandmother;
not telling her, indeed, of the dread reputation she possessed,
or how we suspected her of having so fearfully blighted that
innocent girl; but, at the same time, hoping much from the
mysterious stirring of blood, which Mistress Clarke trusted in
for the removal of the curse.&nbsp; They had come, by a different
route from that which I had taken, to a village inn not far from
Coldholme, only the night before.&nbsp; This was the first
interview between ancestress and descendant.</p>
<p>All through the sultry noon I wandered along the tangled
brush-wood of the old neglected forest, thinking where to turn
for remedy in a matter so complicated and mysterious.&nbsp;
Meeting a countryman, I asked my way to the nearest clergyman,
and went, hoping to obtain some counsel from him.&nbsp; But he
proved to be a coarse and common-minded man, giving no time or
attention to the intricacies of a case, but dashing out a strong
opinion involving immediate action.&nbsp; For instance, as soon
as I named Bridget Fitzgerald, he exclaimed:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Coldholme witch! the Irish papist!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
have had her ducked long since but for that other papist, Sir
Philip Tempest.&nbsp; He has had to threaten honest folk about
here over and over again, or they&rsquo;d have had her up before
the justices for her black doings.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s the law
of the land that witches should be burnt!&nbsp; Ay, and of
Scripture, too, sir!&nbsp; Yet you see a papist, if he&rsquo;s a
rich squire, can overrule both law and Scripture.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
carry a faggot myself to rid the country of her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a one could give me no help.&nbsp; I rather drew back
what I had already said; and tried to make the parson forget it,
by treating him to several pots of beer, in the village inn, to
which we had adjourned for our conference at his
suggestion.&nbsp; I left him as soon as I could, and returned to
Coldholme, shaping my way past deserted Starkey Manor-house, and
coming upon it by the back.&nbsp; At that side were the oblong
remains of the old moat, the waters of which lay placid and
motionless under the crimson rays of the setting sun; with the
forest-trees lying straight along each side, and their deep-green
foliage mirrored to blackness in the burnished surface of the
moat below&mdash;and the broken sun-dial at the end nearest the
hall&mdash;and the heron, standing on one leg at the
water&rsquo;s edge, lazily looking down for fish&mdash;the lonely
and desolate house scarce needed the broken windows, the weeds on
the door-sill, the broken shutter softly flapping to and fro in
the twilight breeze, to fill up the picture of desertion and
decay.&nbsp; I lingered about the place until the growing
darkness warned me on.&nbsp; And then I passed along the path,
cut by the orders of the last lady of Starkey Manor-House, that
led me to Bridget&rsquo;s cottage.&nbsp; I resolved at once to
see her; and, in spite of closed doors&mdash;it might be of
resolved will&mdash;she should see me.&nbsp; So I knocked at her
door, gently, loudly, fiercely.&nbsp; I shook it so vehemently
that a length the old hinges gave way, and with a crash it fell
inwards, leaving me suddenly face to face with Bridget&mdash;I,
red, heated, agitated with my so long baffled efforts&mdash;she,
stiff as any stone, standing right facing me, her eyes dilated
with terror, her ashen lips trembling, but her body
motionless.&nbsp; In her hands she held her crucifix, as if by
that holy symbol she sought to oppose my entrance.&nbsp; At sight
of me, her whole frame relaxed, and she sank back upon a
chair.&nbsp; Some mighty tension had given way.&nbsp; Still her
eyes looked fearfully into the gloom of the outer air, made more
opaque by the glimmer of the lamp inside, which she had placed
before the picture of the Virgin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she there?&rdquo; asked Bridget, hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&nbsp; Who?&nbsp; I am alone.&nbsp; You remember
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied she, still terror stricken.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But she&mdash;that creature&mdash;has been looking in upon
me through that window all day long.&nbsp; I closed it up with my
shawl; and then I saw her feet below the door, as long as it was
light, and I knew she heard my very breathing&mdash;nay, worse,
my very prayers; and I could not pray, for her listening choked
the words ere they rose to my lips.&nbsp; Tell me, who is
she?&mdash;what means that double girl I saw this morning?&nbsp;
One had a look of my dead Mary; but the other curdled my blood,
and yet it was the same!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had taken hold of my arm, as if to secure herself some
human companionship.&nbsp; She shook all over with the slight,
never-ceasing tremor of intense terror.&nbsp; I told her my tale
as I have told it you, sparing none of the details.</p>
<p>How Mistress Clarke had informed me that the resemblance had
driven Lucy forth from her father&rsquo;s house&mdash;how I had
disbelieved, until, with mine own eyes, I had seen another Lucy
standing behind my Lucy, the same in form and feature, but with
the demon-soul looking out of the eyes.&nbsp; I told her all, I
say, believing that she&mdash;whose curse was working so upon the
life of her innocent grandchild&mdash;was the only person who
could find the remedy and the redemption.&nbsp; When I had done,
she sat silent for many minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You love Mary&rsquo;s child?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, in spite of the fearful working of the
curse&mdash;I love her.&nbsp; Yet I shrink from her ever since
that day on the moor-side.&nbsp; And men must shrink from one so
accompanied; friends and lovers must stand afar off.&nbsp; Oh,
Bridget Fitzgerald! loosen the curse!&nbsp; Set her
free!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I eagerly caught at the idea that her presence was needed, in
order that, by some strange prayer or exorcism, the spell might
be reversed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go and bring her to you,&rdquo; I
exclaimed.&nbsp; Bridget tightened her hold upon my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; said she, in a low, hoarse voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would kill me to see her again as I saw her this
morning.&nbsp; And I must live till I have worked my work.&nbsp;
Leave me!&rdquo; said she, suddenly, and again taking up the
cross.&nbsp; &ldquo;I defy the demon I have called up.&nbsp;
Leave me to wrestle with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up, as if in an ecstasy of inspiration, from which
all fear was banished.&nbsp; I lingered&mdash;why I can hardly
tell&mdash;until once more she bade me begone.&nbsp; As I went
along the forest way, I looked back, and saw her planting the
cross in the empty threshold, where the door had been.</p>
<p>The next morning Lucy and I went to seek her, to bid her join
her prayers with ours.&nbsp; The cottage stood open and wide to
our gaze.&nbsp; No human being was there: the cross remained on
the threshold, but Bridget was gone.</p>
 <h2 id="chapter3"> CHAPTER III. </h2>
<p><span class="smcap">What</span> was to be done next? was the
question that I asked myself.&nbsp; As for Lucy, she would fain
have submitted to the doom that lay upon her.&nbsp; Her
gentleness and piety, under the pressure of so horrible a life,
seemed over-passive to me.&nbsp; She never complained.&nbsp; Mrs.
Clarke complained more than ever.&nbsp; As for me, I was more in
love with the real Lucy than ever; but I shrunk from the false
similitude with an intensity proportioned to my love.&nbsp; I
found out by instinct that Mrs. Clarke had occasional temptations
to leave Lucy.&nbsp; The good lady&rsquo;s nerves were shaken,
and, from what she said, I could almost have concluded that the
object of the Double was to drive away from Lucy this last, and
almost earliest friend.&nbsp; At times, I could scarcely bear to
own it, but I myself felt inclined to turn recreant; and I would
accuse Lucy of being too patient&mdash;too resigned.&nbsp; One
after another, she won the little children of Coldholme.&nbsp;
(Mrs. Clarke and she had resolved to stay there, for was it not
as good a place as any other, to such as they? and did not all
our faint hopes rest on Bridget&mdash;never seen or heard of now,
but still we trusted to come back, or give some token?)&nbsp; So,
as I say, one after another, the little children came about my
Lucy, won by her soft tones, and her gentle smiles, and kind
actions.&nbsp; Alas! one after another they fell away, and shrunk
from her path with blanching terror; and we too surely guessed
the reason why.&nbsp; It was the last drop.&nbsp; I could bear it
no longer.&nbsp; I resolved no more to linger around the spot,
but to go back to my uncle, and among the learned divines of the
city of London, seek for some power whereby to annul the
curse.</p>
<p>My uncle, meanwhile, had obtained all the requisite
testimonials relating to Lucy&rsquo;s descent and birth, from the
Irish lawyers, and from Mr. Gisborne.&nbsp; The latter gentleman
had written from abroad (he was again serving in the Austrian
army), a letter alternately passionately self-reproachful and
stoically repellant.&nbsp; It was evident that when he thought of
Mary&mdash;her short life&mdash;how he had wronged her, and of
her violent death, he could hardly find words severe enough for
his own conduct; and from this point of view, the curse that
Bridget had laid upon him and his, was regarded by him as a
prophetic doom, to the utterance of which she was moved by a
Higher Power, working for the fulfilment of a deeper vengeance
than for the death of the poor dog.&nbsp; But then, again, when
he came to speak of his daughter, the repugnance which the
conduct of the demoniac creature had produced in his mind, was
but ill-disguised under a show of profound indifference as to
Lucy&rsquo;s fate.&nbsp; One almost felt as if he would have been
as content to put her out of existence, as he would have been to
destroy some disgusting reptile that had invaded his chamber or
his couch.</p>
<p>The great Fitzgerald property was Lucy&rsquo;s; and that was
all&mdash;was nothing.</p>
<p>My uncle and I sat in the gloom of a London November evening,
in our house in Ormond Street.&nbsp; I was out of health, and
felt as if I were in an inextricable coil of misery.&nbsp; Lucy
and I wrote to each other, but that was little; and we dared not
see each other for dread of the fearful Third, who had more than
once taken her place at our meetings.&nbsp; My uncle had, on the
day I speak of, bidden prayers to be put up on the ensuing
Sabbath in many a church and meeting-house in London, for one
grievously tormented by an evil spirit.&nbsp; He had faith in
prayers&mdash;I had none; I was fast losing faith in all
things.&nbsp; So we sat, he trying to interest me in the old talk
of other days, I oppressed by one thought&mdash;when our old
servant, Anthony, opened the door, and, without speaking, showed
in a very gentlemanly and prepossessing man, who had something
remarkable about his dress, betraying his profession to be that
of the Roman Catholic priesthood.&nbsp; He glanced at my uncle
first, then at me.&nbsp; It was to me he bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not give my name,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;because
you would hardly have recognised it; unless, sir, when, in the
north, you heard of Father Bernard, the chaplain at Stoney
Hurst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered afterwards that I had heard of him, but at the
time I had utterly forgotten it; so I professed myself a complete
stranger to him; while my ever-hospitable uncle, although hating
a papist as much as it was in his nature to hate anything, placed
a chair for the visitor, and bade Anthony bring glasses, and a
fresh jug of claret.</p>
<p>Father Bernard received this courtesy with the graceful ease
and pleasant acknowledgement which belongs to a man of the
world.&nbsp; Then he turned to scan me with his keen
glance.&nbsp; After some alight conversation, entered into on his
part, I am certain, with an intention of discovering on what
terms of confidence I stood with my uncle, he paused, and said
gravely&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sent here with a message to you, sir, from a woman
to whom you have shown kindness, and who is one of my penitents,
in Antwerp&mdash;one Bridget Fitzgerald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bridget Fitzgerald!&rdquo; exclaimed I.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
Antwerp?&nbsp; Tell me, sir, all that you can about
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much to be said,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But may I inquire if this gentleman&mdash;if your uncle is
acquainted with the particulars of which you and I stand
informed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that I know, he knows,&rdquo; said I, eagerly
laying my hand on my uncle&rsquo;s arm, as he made a motion as if
to quit the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have to speak before two gentlemen who, however
they may differ from me in faith, are yet fully impressed with
the fact that there are evil powers going about continually to
take cognizance of our evil thoughts: and, if their Master gives
them power, to bring them into overt action.&nbsp; Such is my
theory of the nature of that sin, which I dare not
disbelieve&mdash;as some sceptics would have us do&mdash;the sin
of witchcraft.&nbsp; Of this deadly sin, you and I are aware,
Bridget Fitzgerald has been guilty.&nbsp; Since you saw her last,
many prayers have been offered in our churches, many masses sung,
many penances undergone, in order that, if God and the holy
saints so willed it, her sin might be blotted out.&nbsp; But it
has not been so willed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain to me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;who you are, and
how you come connected with Bridget.&nbsp; Why is she at
Antwerp?&nbsp; I pray you, sir, tell me more.&nbsp; If I am
impatient, excuse me; I am ill and feverish, and in consequence
bewildered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something to me inexpressibly soothing in the tone
of voice with which he began to narrate, as it were from the
beginning, his acquaintance with Bridget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had known Mr. and Mrs. Starkey during their residence
abroad, and so it fell out naturally that, when I came as
chaplain to the Sherburnes at Stoney Hurst, our acquaintance was
renewed; and thus I became the confessor of the whole family,
isolated as they were from the offices of the Church, Sherburne
being their nearest neighbour who professed the true faith.&nbsp;
Of course, you are aware that facts revealed in confession are
sealed as in the grave; but I learnt enough of Bridget&rsquo;s
character to be convinced that I had to do with no common woman;
one powerful for good as for evil.&nbsp; I believe that I was
able to give her spiritual assistance from time to time, and that
she looked upon me as a servant of that Holy Church, which has
such wonderful power of moving men&rsquo;s hearts, and relieving
them of the burden of their sins.&nbsp; I have known her cross
the moors on the wildest nights of storm, to confess and be
absolved; and then she would return, calmed and subdued, to her
daily work about her mistress, no one witting where she had been
during the hours that most passed in sleep upon their beds.&nbsp;
After her daughter&rsquo;s departure&mdash;after Mary&rsquo;s
mysterious disappearance&mdash;I had to impose many a long
penance, in order to wash away the sin of impatient repining that
was fast leading her into the deeper guilt of blasphemy.&nbsp;
She set out on that long journey of which you have possibly
heard&mdash;that fruitless journey in search of Mary&mdash;and
during her absence, my superiors ordered my return to my former
duties at Antwerp, and for many years I heard no more of
Bridget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not many months ago, as I was passing homewards in the
evening, along one of the streets near St. Jacques, leading into
the Meer Straet, I saw a woman sitting crouched up under the
shrine of the Holy Mother of Sorrows.&nbsp; Her hood was drawn
over her head, so that the shadow caused by the light of the lamp
above fell deep over her face; her hands were clasped round her
knees.&nbsp; It was evident that she was some one in hopeless
trouble, and as such it was my duty to stop and speak.&nbsp; I
naturally addressed her first in Flemish, believing her to be one
of the lower class of inhabitants.&nbsp; She shook her head, but
did not look up.&nbsp; Then I tried French, and she replied in
that language, but speaking it so indifferently, that I was sure
she was either English or Irish, and consequently spoke to her in
my own native tongue.&nbsp; She recognized my voice; and,
starting up, caught at my robes, dragging me before the blessed
shrine, and throwing herself down, and forcing me, as much by her
evident desire as by her action, to kneel beside her, she
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;O Holy Virgin! you will never hearken to me
again, but hear him; for you know him of old, that he does your
bidding, and strives to heal broken hearts.&nbsp; Hear
him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She turned to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She will hear you, if you will only pray.&nbsp;
She never hears <i>me</i>: she and all the saints in heaven
cannot hear my prayers, for the Evil One carries them off, as he
carried that first away.&nbsp; O, Father Bernard, pray for
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prayed for one in sore distress, of what nature I
could not say; but the Holy Virgin would know.&nbsp; Bridget held
me fast, gasping with eagerness at the sound of my words.&nbsp;
When I had ended, I rose, and, making the sign of the Cross over
her, I was going to bless her in the name of the Holy Church,
when she shrank away like some terrified creature, and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am guilty of deadly sin, and am not
shriven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Arise, my daughter,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;and
come with me.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I led the way into one of the
confessionals of St. Jaques.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knelt; I listened.&nbsp; No words came.&nbsp; The
evil powers had stricken her dumb, as I heard afterwards they had
many a time before, when she approached confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was too poor to pay for the necessary forms of
exorcism; and hitherto those priests to whom she had addressed
herself were either so ignorant of the meaning of her broken
French, or her Irish-English, or else esteemed her to be one
crazed&mdash;as, indeed, her wild and excited manner might easily
have led any one to think&mdash;that they had neglected the sole
means of loosening her tongue, so that she might confess her
deadly sin, and, after due penance, obtain absolution.&nbsp; But
I knew Bridget of old, and felt that she was a penitent sent to
me.&nbsp; I went through those holy offices appointed by our
Church for the relief of such a case.&nbsp; I was the more bound
to do this, as I found that she had come to Antwerp for the sole
purpose of discovering me, and making confession to me.&nbsp; Of
the nature of that fearful confession I am forbidden to
speak.&nbsp; Much of it you know; possibly all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It now remains for her to free herself from mortal
guilt, and to set others free from the consequences
thereof.&nbsp; No prayers, no masses, will ever do it, although
they may strengthen her with that strength by which alone acts of
deepest love and purest self-devotion may be performed.&nbsp; Her
words of passion, and cries for revenge&mdash;her unholy prayers
could never reach the ears of the holy saints!&nbsp; Other powers
intercepted them, and wrought so that the curses thrown up to
heaven have fallen on her own flesh and blood; and so, through
her very strength of love, have brused and crushed her
heart.&nbsp; Henceforward her former self must be
buried,&mdash;yea, buried quick, if need be,&mdash;but never more
to make sign, or utter cry on earth!&nbsp; She has become a Poor
Clare, in order that, by perpetual penance and constant service
of others, she may at length so act as to obtain final absolution
and rest for her soul.&nbsp; Until then, the innocent must
suffer.&nbsp; It is to plead for the innocent that I come to you;
not in the name of the witch, Bridget Fitzgerald, but of the
penitent and servant of all men, the Poor Clare, Sister
Magdalen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I listen to your request
with respect; only I may tell you it is not needed to urge me to
do all that I can on behalf of one, love for whom is part of my
very life.&nbsp; If for a time I have absented myself from her,
it is to think and work for her redemption.&nbsp; I, a member of
the English Church&mdash;my uncle, a Puritan&mdash;pray morning
and night for her by name: the congregations of London, on the
next Sabbath, will pray for one unknown, that she may be set free
from the Powers of Darkness.&nbsp; Moreover, I must tell you,
sir, that those evil ones touch not the great calm of her
soul.&nbsp; She lives her own pure and loving life, unharmed and
untainted, though all men fall off from her.&nbsp; I would I
could have her faith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle now spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it seems to me that this
gentleman, although professing what I consider an erroneous
creed, has touched upon the right point in exhorting Bridget to
acts of love and mercy, whereby to wipe out her sin of hate and
vengeance.&nbsp; Let us strive after our fashion, by almsgiving
and visiting of the needy and fatherless, to make our prayers
acceptable.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I myself will go down into the
north, and take charge of the maiden.&nbsp; I am too old to be
daunted by man or demon.&nbsp; I will bring her to this house as
to a home; and let the Double come if it will!&nbsp; A company of
godly divines shall give it the meeting, and we will try
issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kindly, brave old man!&nbsp; But Father Bernard sat on
musing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;cannot be quenched in
her heart; all Christian forgiveness cannot have entered into her
soul, or the demon would have lost its power.&nbsp; You said, I
think, that her grandchild was still tormented?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still tormented!&rdquo;&nbsp; I replied, sadly,
thinking of Mistress Clarke&rsquo;s last letter&mdash;He rose to
go.&nbsp; We afterwards heard that the occasion of his coming to
London was a secret political mission on behalf of the
Jacobites.&nbsp; Nevertheless, he was a good and a wise man.</p>
<p>Months and months passed away without any change.&nbsp; Lucy
entreated my uncle to leave her where she was,&mdash;dreading, as
I learnt, lest if she came, with her fearful companion, to dwell
in the same house with me, that my love could not stand the
repeated shocks to which I should be doomed.&nbsp; And this she
thought from no distrust of the strength of my affection, but
from a kind of pitying sympathy for the terror to the nerves
which she clearly observed that the demoniac visitation caused in
all.</p>
<p>I was restless and miserable.&nbsp; I devoted myself to good
works; but I performed them from no spirit of love, but solely
from the hope of reward and payment, and so the reward was never
granted.&nbsp; At length, I asked my uncle&rsquo;s leave to
travel; and I went forth, a wanderer, with no distincter end than
that of many another wanderer&mdash;to get away from
myself.&nbsp; A strange impulse led me to Antwerp, in spite of
the wars and commotions then raging in the Low Countries&mdash;or
rather, perhaps, the very craving to become interested in
something external, led me into the thick of the struggle then
going on with the Austrians.&nbsp; The cities of Flanders were
all full at that time of civil disturbances and rebellions, only
kept down by force, and the presence of an Austrian garrison in
every place.</p>
<p>I arrived in Antwerp, and made inquiry for Father
Bernard.&nbsp; He was away in the country for a day or two.&nbsp;
Then I asked my way to the Convent of Poor Clares; but, being
healthy and prosperous, I could only see the dim, pent-up, gray
walls, shut closely in by narrow streets, in the lowest part of
the town.&nbsp; My landlord told me, that had I been stricken by
some loathsome disease, or in desperate case of any kind, the
Poor Clares would have taken me, and tended me.&nbsp; He spoke of
them as an order of mercy of the strictest kind, dressing
scantily in the coarsest materials, going barefoot, living on
what the inhabitants of Antwerp chose to bestow, and sharing even
those fragments and crumbs with the poor and helpless that
swarmed all around; receiving no letters or communication with
the outer world; utterly dead to everything but the alleviation
of suffering.&nbsp; He smiled at my inquiring whether I could get
speech of one of them; and told me that they were even forbidden
to speak for the purposes of begging their daily food; while yet
they lived, and fed others upon what was given in charity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; exclaimed I, &ldquo;supposing all men
forgot them!&nbsp; Would they quietly lie down and die, without
making sign of their extremity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If such were the rule the Poor Clares would willingly
do it; but their founder appointed a remedy for such extreme
cases as you suggest.&nbsp; They have a bell&mdash;&rsquo;tis but
a small one, as I have heard, and has yet never been rung in the
memory man: when the Poor Clares have been without food for
twenty-four hours, they may ring this bell, and then trust to our
good people of Antwerp for rushing to the rescue of the Poor
Clares, who have taken such blessed care of us in all our
straits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to me that such rescue would be late in the day; but
I did not say what I thought.&nbsp; I rather turned the
conversation, by asking my landlord if he knew, or had ever
heard, anything of a certain Sister Magdalen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, rather under his breath,
&ldquo;news will creep out, even from a convent of Poor
Clares.&nbsp; Sister Magdalen is either a great sinner or a great
saint.&nbsp; She does more, as I have heard, than all the other
nuns put together; yet, when last month they would fain have made
her mother-superior, she begged rather that they would place her
below all the rest, and make her the meanest servant of
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never saw her?&rdquo; asked I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>I was weary of waiting for Father Bernard, and yet I lingered
in Antwerp.&nbsp; The political state of things became worse than
ever, increased to its height by the scarcity of food consequent
on many deficient harvests.&nbsp; I saw groups of fierce, squalid
men, at every corner of the street, glaring out with wolfish eyes
at my sleek skin and handsome clothes.</p>
<p>At last Father Bernard returned.&nbsp; We had a long
conversation, in which he told me that, curiously enough, Mr.
Gisborne, Lucy&rsquo;s father, was serving in one of the Austrian
regiments, then in garrison at Antwerp.&nbsp; I asked Father
Bernard if he would make us acquainted; which he consented to
do.&nbsp; But, a day or two afterwards, he told me that, on
hearing my name, Mr. Gisborne had declined responding to any
advances on my part, saying he had adjured his country, and hated
his countrymen.</p>
<p>Probably he recollected my name in connection with that of his
daughter Lucy.&nbsp; Anyhow, it was clear enough that I had no
chance of making his acquaintance.&nbsp; Father Bernard confirmed
me in my suspicions of the hidden fermentation, for some coming
evil, working among the &ldquo;blouses&rdquo; of Antwerp, and he
would fain have had me depart from out the city; but I rather
craved the excitement of danger, and stubbornly refused to
leave.</p>
<p>One day, when I was walking with him in the Place Verte, he
bowed to an Austrian officer, who was crossing towards the
cathedral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Mr. Gisborne,&rdquo; said he, as soon as the
gentleman was past.</p>
<p>I turned to look at the tall, slight figure of the
officer.&nbsp; He carried himself in a stately manner, although
he was past middle age, and from his years might have had some
excuse for a slight stoop.&nbsp; As I looked at the man, he
turned round, his eyes met mine, and I saw his face.&nbsp; Deeply
lined, sallow, and scathed was that countenance; scarred by
passion as well as by the fortunes of war.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas but
a moment our eyes met.&nbsp; We each turned round, and went on
our separate way.</p>
<p>But his whole appearance was not one to be easily forgotten;
the thorough appointment of the dress, and evident thought
bestowed on it, made but an incongruous whole with the dark,
gloomy expression of his countenance.&nbsp; Because he was
Lucy&rsquo;s father, I sought instinctively to meet him
everywhere.&nbsp; At last he must have become aware of my
pertinacity, for he gave me a haughty scowl whenever I passed
him.&nbsp; In one of these encounters, however, I chanced to be
of some service to him.&nbsp; He was turning the corner of a
street, and came suddenly on one of the groups of discontented
Flemings of whom I have spoken.&nbsp; Some words were exchanged,
when my gentleman out with his sword, and with a slight but
skilful cut drew blood from one of those who had insulted him, as
he fancied, though I was too far off to hear the words.&nbsp;
They would all have fallen upon him had I not rushed forwards and
raised the cry, then well known in Antwerp, of rally, to the
Austrian soldiers who were perpetually patrolling the streets,
and who came in numbers to the rescue.&nbsp; I think that neither
Mr. Gisborne nor the mutinous group of plebeians owed me much
gratitude for my interference.&nbsp; He had planted himself
against a wall, in a skilful attitude of fence, ready with his
bright glancing rapier to do battle with all the heavy, fierce,
unarmed men, some six or seven in number.&nbsp; But when his own
soldiers came up, he sheathed his sword; and, giving some
careless word of command, sent them away again, and continued his
saunter all alone down the street, the workmen snarling in his
rear, and more than half-inclined to fall on me for my cry for
rescue.&nbsp; I cared not if they did, my life seemed so dreary a
burden just then; and, perhaps, it was this daring loitering
among them that prevented their attacking me.&nbsp; Instead, they
suffered me to fall into conversation with them; and I heard some
of their grievances.&nbsp; Sore and heavy to be borne were they,
and no wonder the sufferers were savage and desperate.</p>
<p>The man whom Gisborne had wounded across his face would fain
have got out of me the name of his aggressor, but I refused to
tell it.&nbsp; Another of the group heard his inquiry, and made
answer&mdash;&ldquo;I know the man.&nbsp; He is one Gisborne,
aide-de-camp to the General-Commandant.&nbsp; I know him
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to tell some story in connection with Gisborne in a
low and muttering voice; and while he was relating a tale, which
I saw excited their evil blood, and which they evidently wished
me not to hear, I sauntered away and back to my lodgings.</p>
<p>That night Antwerp was in open revolt.&nbsp; The inhabitants
rose in rebellion against their Austrian masters.&nbsp; The
Austrians, holding the gates of the city, remained at first
pretty quiet in the citadel; only, from time to time, the boom of
the great cannon swept sullenly over the town.&nbsp; But if they
expected the disturbance to die away, and spend itself in a few
hours&rsquo; fury, they were mistaken.&nbsp; In a day or two, the
rioters held possession of the principal municipal
buildings.&nbsp; Then the Austrians poured forth in bright
flaming array, calm and smiling, as they marched to the posts
assigned, as if the fierce mob were no more to them then the
swarms of buzzing summer flies.&nbsp; Their practised
man&oelig;uvres, their well-aimed shot, told with terrible
effect; but in the place of one slain rioter, three sprang up of
his blood to avenge his loss.&nbsp; But a deadly foe, a ghastly
ally of the Austrians, was at work.&nbsp; Food, scarce and dear
for months, was now hardly to be obtained at any price.&nbsp;
Desperate efforts were being made to bring provisions into the
city, for the rioters had friends without.&nbsp; Close to the
city port, nearest to the Scheldt, a great struggle took
place.&nbsp; I was there, helping the rioters, whose cause I had
adopted.&nbsp; We had a savage encounter with the
Austrians.&nbsp; Numbers fell on both sides: I saw them lie
bleeding for a moment: then a volley of smoke obscured them; and
when it cleared away, they were dead&mdash;trampled upon or
smothered, pressed down and hidden by the freshly-wounded whom
those last guns had brought low.&nbsp; And then a gray-robed and
grey-veiled figure came right across the flashing guns and
stooped over some one, whose life-blood was ebbing away;
sometimes it was to give him drink from cans which they carried
slung at their sides; sometimes I saw the cross held above a
dying man, and rapid prayers were being uttered, unheard by men
in that hellish din and clangour, but listened to by One
above.&nbsp; I saw all this as in a dream: the reality of that
stern time was battle and carnage.&nbsp; But I knew that these
gray figures, their bare feet all wet with blood, and their faces
hidden by their veils, were the Poor Clares&mdash;sent forth now
because dire agony was abroad and imminent danger at hand.&nbsp;
Therefore, they left their cloistered shelter, and came into that
thick and evil m&ecirc;l&eacute;e.</p>
<p>Close to me&mdash;driven past me by the struggle of many
fighters&mdash;came the Antwerp burgess with the scarce-healed
scar upon his face; and in an instant more, he was thrown by the
press upon the Austrian officer Gisborne, and ere either had
recovered the shock, the burgess had recognized his opponent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! the Englishman Gisborne!&rdquo; he cried, and threw
himself upon him with redoubled fury.&nbsp; He had struck him
hard&mdash;the Englishman was down; when out of the smoke came a
dark-gray figure, and threw herself right under the uplifted
flashing sword.&nbsp; The burgess&rsquo;s arm stood
arrested.&nbsp; Neither Austrians nor Anversois willingly harmed
the Poor Clares.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him to me!&rdquo; said a low stern voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is mine enemy&mdash;mine for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those words were the last I heard.&nbsp; I myself was struck
down by a bullet.&nbsp; I remember nothing more for days.&nbsp;
When I came to myself, I was at the extremity of weakness, and
was craving for food to recruit my strength.&nbsp; My landlord
sat watching me.&nbsp; He, too, looked pinched and shrunken; he
had heard of my wounded state, and sought me out.&nbsp; Yes! the
struggle still continued, but the famine was sore: and some, he
had heard, had died for lack of food.&nbsp; The tears stood in
his eyes as he spoke.&nbsp; But soon he shook off his weakness,
and his natural cheerfulness returned.&nbsp; Father Bernard had
been to see me&mdash;no one else.&nbsp; (Who should, indeed?)
Father Bernard would come back that afternoon&mdash;he had
promised.&nbsp; But Father Bernard never came, although I was up
and dressed, and looking eagerly for him.</p>
<p>My landlord brought me a meal which he had cooked himself: of
what it was composed he would not say, but it was most excellent,
and with every mouthful I seemed to gain strength.&nbsp; The good
man sat looking at my evident enjoyment with a happy smile of
sympathy; but, as my appetite became satisfied, I began to detect
a certain wistfulness in his eyes, as if craving for the food I
had so nearly devoured&mdash;for, indeed, at that time I was
hardly aware of the extent of the famine.&nbsp; Suddenly, there
was a sound of many rushing feet past our window.&nbsp; My
landlord opened one of the sides of it, the better to learn what
was going on.&nbsp; Then we heard a faint, cracked, tinkling
bell, coming shrill upon the air, clear and distinct from all
other sounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Holy Mother!&rdquo; exclaimed my
landlord, &ldquo;the Poor Clares!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snatched up the fragments of my meal, and crammed them into
my hands, bidding me follow.&nbsp; Down stairs he ran, clutching
at more food, as the women of his house eagerly held it out to
him; and in a moment we were in the street, moving along with the
great current, all tending towards the Convent of the Poor
Clares.&nbsp; And still, as if piercing our ears with its
inarticulate cry, came the shrill tinkle of the bell.&nbsp; In
that strange crowd were old men trembling and sobbing, as they
carried their little pittance of food; women with tears running
down their cheeks, who had snatched up what provisions they had
in the vessels in which they stood, so that the burden of these
was in many cases much greater than that which they contained;
children, with flushed faces, grasping tight the morsel of bitten
cake or bread, in their eagerness to carry it safe to the help of
the Poor Clares; strong men&mdash;yea, both Anversois and
Austrians&mdash;pressing onward with set teeth, and no word
spoken; and over all, and through all, came that sharp
tinkle&mdash;that cry for help in extremity.</p>
<p>We met the first torrent of people returning with blanched and
piteous faces: they were issuing out of the convent to make way
for the offerings of others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haste, haste!&rdquo;
said they.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Poor Clare is dying!&nbsp; A Poor Clare
is dead for hunger!&nbsp; God forgive us and our city!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We pressed on.&nbsp; The stream bore us along where it
would.&nbsp; We were carried through refectories, bare and
crumbless; into cells over whose doors the conventual name of the
occupant was written.&nbsp; Thus it was that I, with others, was
forced into Sister Magdalen&rsquo;s cell.&nbsp; On her couch lay
Gisborne, pale unto death, but not dead.&nbsp; By his side was a
cup of water, and a small morsel of mouldy bread, which he had
pushed out of his reach, and could not move to obtain.&nbsp; Over
against his bed were these words, copied in the English version
&ldquo;Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst,
give him drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of us gave him of our food, and left him eating greedily,
like some famished wild animal.&nbsp; For now it was no longer
the sharp tinkle, but that one solemn toll, which in all
Christian countries tells of the passing of the spirit out of
earthly life into eternity; and again a murmur gathered and grew,
as of many people speaking with awed breath, &ldquo;A Poor Clare
is dying! a Poor Clare is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Borne along once more by the motion of the crowd, we were
carried into the chapel belonging to the Poor Clares.&nbsp; On a
bier before the high altar, lay a woman&mdash;lay Sister
Magdalen&mdash;lay Bridget Fitzgerald.&nbsp; By her side stood
Father Bernard, in his robes of office, and holding the crucifix
on high while he pronounced the solemn absolution of the Church,
as to one who had newly confessed herself of deadly sin.&nbsp; I
pushed on with passionate force, till I stood close to the dying
woman, as she received extreme unction amid the breathless and
awed hush of the multitude around.&nbsp; Her eyes were glazing,
her limbs were stiffening; but when the rite was over and
finished, she raised her gaunt figure slowly up, and her eyes
brightened to a strange intensity of joy, as, with the gesture of
her finger and the trance-like gleam of her eye, she seemed like
one who watched the disappearance of some loathed and fearful
creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is freed from the curse!&rdquo; said she, as she
fell back dead.</p>
