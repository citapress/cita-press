   Meditations on the Song of Songs - Santa Teresa de Jes&uacute;s

  <section id="foreword">
    <p> Introduction</p>
    <p>
It is puzzling that we can read Saint Teresa of Jesus’ Meditations on the Song of Songs today.  Her confessor ordered the destruction of the manuscript out of fear that it could reach the Inquisition, and, according to witnesses, Teresa burned it right before his eyes. But did she  know about the existence of other copies? Was her obedience sincere, or simply a performative acknowledgement of the authority of her confessor? </p><p>

The life and legacy of Teresa of Jesus1(1515-1582) gathers together many contradictions. Conservative groups have revered her as a symbol of orthodoxy, obedience, and humility. Francisco Franco’s devotion to Teresa, for example, is well known. Up until his death, the dictator treasured the relic of Teresa’s hand in his private chapel. On the opposite end of the ideological spectrum, Teresa has been proclaimed a feminist icon. Numerous artists and critics have dedicated entire works to the study of her revolutionary language, celebrating its abundance of erotic mysticism. </p><p>

The sixteenth century was a time of intense strife between growing Protestantism and the attempt of the Catholic Church to preserve its rule over Europe. During Teresa’s lifetime, Spain set its religious unification as a political principle. In service of this, the Spanish  Inquisition sought to force the conversion or attain the expulsion of Jews and Muslims and to control the spread of heresies, especially those derived from the Lutheran Reformation. The Church demanded absolute subjection to its doctrine. It was amid this difficult context that Teresa undertook an ambitious and controversial project of religious reform. </p><p>

Despite currently being one of the most popular and venerated saints in the Catholic world, Teresa not only spent a great part of her life under the shadow of the Inquisition, but she died fearing that ecclesiastical authorities would delegitimize her legacy. There were several reasons for this. The main one was that, around the age of forty and two decades after having professed as a nun in a convent of the Carmelite order in Avila, Teresa started to report to her confessors that she had recurring visions of Christ, saints, angels, and  demons. These visions, common to many women at the time, were frequently interpreted by the public and by religious authorities as deceptive tricks from the devil, as physical or mental illnesses, or as fraudulent attempts to garner fame and  recognition. </p><p>

During one of her visions, Teresa received the instruction to found a convent where nuns would practice a spirituality of greater recollection and strict enclosure and poverty. This reform would lead to the creation of seventeen convents for monks and nuns all across Spain. After numerous disputes with the Carmelites, members of the nobility, and representatives from the Vatican, Teresa finally became the founder of a new and  independent religious order: that of the Discalced Carmelites.  </p><p>

In addition to being a visionary and a founder, Teresa was also a descendant of a family of  “new Christians,”--or Jewish converts--and a writer. She dared to write at a time when women were relentlessly silenced, particularly whenever they tried to discuss theological matters. All of these elements turned Teresa into an easy target of suspicions of heresy, heterodoxy, and insubordination. </p><p>

In the midst of such adversity, the extent of her written work is astonishing. Her writings include various treatises on spiritual life, the story of the foundation of her convents, the Constitutions of her new religious order, and an impressive collection of over 700 letters, works of poetry, and even conventual accounting books. Among all of these works, her Mediations stand out for being, perhaps, the most daring. </p><p>

Friar Luis de León, a contemporary of Teresa and the first editor of her works, was  imprisoned by the Inquisition after he commented and translated the <i>Song of  Songs</i> into Spanish. This Biblical text has been the object of numerous interpretations due to the  eroticism of its images. It was an essential book for various mystics who found in it the  metaphorical expression of the union between God and the soul. Teresa was no exception. </p><p>

In her Meditations, she analyzes suggestive verses of the Song of Songs, such as “Let him kiss  me with the kisses of his mouth; for thy love is better than wine.” But before she engages  with the text, she warns that she writes her comments only by the order of a superior. She  adds that, as a woman, she does not aspire to the theological knowledge of learned men, and thus her words are merely destined to prod the devotion of her nuns. Finally, she  maintains that if the reader finds anything worthy in her text, they should attribute it to the  grace of God, not to the author. </p><p>

With these clarifications, Teresa points to her confessors as those directly responsible for  any heterodoxy in her work, and she avoids accusations of disobedience or pride for trying  to teach men about matters of faith. Ignorance was thought to be inextricable from the  female condition, and by acknowledging her own, Teresa puts herself in a position to receive a  superior knowledge, emanated from divinity itself and exempted from men’s judgments. </p><p>

Teresa’s feminism is strategic and survivalist. She understood what punishments the Inquisition reserved for women who tried to act as spiritual authorities. For this reason,  Teresa negotiates her desire to express an intimate and very personal spirituality through  the elaboration of a careful rhetoric of humility and obedience, which we invite our readers  to untangle from the text we present. </p><p>

Teresa’s trajectory of personal survival is as miraculous as the survival  of her <i>Meditations</i>. Despite almost disappearing into the flames ignited by the zealous orthodoxy of some confessor, this text reaches us today, after four and a half centuries of vicissitudes. And what better way to celebrate its continued existence than through this digital edition, freely accessible to any reader from anywhere in the world with access to the internet.</p>

    <p>1. As an explanatory note: we choose to refer to the author as Teresa of Jesus, thereby abiding by her wish to be named according to her religious wish. This decision stands in contrast to the use of Teresa of Avila, the name that has been traditionally used in academic circles. </p>

       MEDITATIONS ON THE SONG OF SONGS
    </h2>
<p style="color:blue"><i> <p> This text is from: </i>The Collected Works
St. Teresa of Avila, Volume Two.<i> Translated by Kieran Kavanaugh, O.C.D. and Otilio Rodriguez, O.C.D. Washington, D.C.: ICS Publications Institute of Carmelite Studies, 1980. </i>Internet Archive,<i> 2021.</p></i></p>
  <h5>  CHAPTER 1 </h5> <p> <i>Treats of the veneration with which the Sacred Scriptures 
should be read and of the difficulty women have in comprehending them, especially the</i> Song of Songs. </p>
<p> &nbsp    &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp <i> Let the Lord kiss me with the kiss of His mouth, for Your breasts are better than wine, etc....(Sg1:2) </i> </p>
    <p>
    1. I HAVE CAREFULLY NOTED that it seems from what is 
manifested here that the soul is speaking with one person 
and asking peace from another. It says: <i>Let Him kiss me with 
the kiss of His mouth</i>; and next, seemingly, it speaks to 
someone whom it is with: <i>Your breasts are better. </i>

I don't understand why this is; and that I don't understand 
gives me great delight. Indeed, daughters, the soul will not 
have to reflect upon the things it seems we can grasp with our 
lowly intellects here below as intensely as it will upon those that 
can in no way be understood; nor will the former make it 
respect God as much as do His mysteries. Thus I highly recommend that when you read some book or hear a sermon or think about the mysteries of our sacred faith you avoid tiring 
yourselves or wasting your thoughts in subtle reasoning about 
what you cannot properly understand. Many things are not 
meant for women to understand, nor even for men. 

    </p>
    <p>
    2. When the Lord desires to give understanding, His Majesty does so without our effort. I am saying this to women, and 
also to men who aren't obliged to defend the truth through 
their learning. For those whom the Lord has called to explain 
the Scriptures to us must understandably work, and they will 
gain much from their work. But we should accept with 
simplicity whatever the Lord gives us; and what He doesn't we 
shouldn't tire ourselves over, but rejoice in considering what a great Lord and God we have. For one word of His will contain 
within itself a thousand mysteries, and thus our understanding 
is only very elementary. That we do not understand His words 
when they are written in Latin or Hebrew or Greek is no surprise. But even in our own language; how many things there 
are in the psalms of the glorious King David that after being 
translated into the vernacular for us remain as obscure as they 
were in Latin! Thus always guard against wasting your 
thoughts on these things or tiring yourselves, for women have 
need of no more than what is sufficient for their meditations. 
With this, God will favor them. When His Majesty desires to 
give us understanding of the words, without worry or work on 
our part, we shall surely find it. As for the rest, let us humble 
ourselves and, as I have said, rejoice that we have such a Lord, 
that even words of His spoken in our own language cannot be 
understood. 
    </p>
    <p>
   3. It will seem to you that there are some words in the <i>Song 
of Songs</i> that could have been said in another style. In light of 
our dullness such an opinion doesn't surprise me. I have heard 
some persons say that they avoid listening to them. Oh, God 
help me, how great is our misery! Just as poisonous creatures 
turn everything they eat into poison, so do we. From favors as 
great as those the Lord gives us here in revealing what is 
possessed by the soul who loves Him and in encouraging it to 
speak with His Majesty and find delight in Him, we have to 
create fears and give opinions that manifest the small degree of 
love of God we have. 
    </p>
    <p>
  4. O my Lord, how poorly we profit from the blessing You 
grant us! You seek ways and means and you devise plans to 
show Your love for us; we, inexperienced in loving You, esteem 
this love so poorly that our minds, little exercised in love, go 
where they always go and cease to think of the great mysteries 
this language, spoken by the Holy Spirit, contains within itself. 
What more was necessary than this language in order to enkindle us in His love and make us realize that not without good 
reason did He choose this style. 
    </p>
    <p>
    5. Indeed, I recall hearing a priest who was a religious 
preach a very admirable sermon, most of which was an explanation of those loving delights with which the bride communed with God. And there was so much laughter, and what 
he said was so poorly taken, that I was shocked. He was speaking about love since the sermon was on Maundy Thursday, 
when one shouldn't be speaking of anything else. And I see 
clearly that the reason for not understanding is the one I mentioned (that we practice so poorly the love of God), for it 
doesn't seem to us possible for a soul to commune in such a way 
with God. These people did not benefit, surely because they 
did not understand, nor, I believe, did they think anything but 
that the preacher made the sermon up in his own head. Yet, I 
know other persons who have drawn out great good, delight, 
and security against fears, so much so that they had to offer 
special praise to our Lord. He has left a salutary remedy to 
souls that love Him with a fervent love because they understand and see that it is possible for God to humble Himself so 
much. For experience was not enough to keep them from fearing when the Lord granted them great favors. What they see 
represented here makes them feel secure. 

    </p>
    <p>
 6. I know someone who for a number of years had many 
fears, and nothing gave her assurance, but the Lord was 
pleased that she hear some words from the <i>Song of Songs</i>, and 
through them she understood that her soul was being well 
guided. As I have said, she understood that it was possible for 
a soul in love with its Spouse to experience all these favors, 
swoons, deaths, afflictions, delights, and joys in relation to 
Him. It does so after it has left all the world's joys out of love 
for Him and is completely given over and abandoned into His 
hands, and when it has done this not just in words, as happens 
with some, but in all truth, confirmed with works.</p> <p>Oh, my daughters, how well God repays! You have a Lord 
and Spouse with whom nothing takes place without His seeing 
and understanding it! Thus, even though the things be very 
small, do not fail to do what you can for love of Him. His Majesty will repay for them; He looks only at the love with which 
you do them.
    </p>
    <p>
  7. Hence, I conclude this matter by saying that you should 
never dwell on what you do not understand in Sacred Scripture or the mysteries of our faith more than I have said, nor should 
you be startled by the lofty words that take place between God 
and the soul. Being what we are, the love that He had and has 
for us surprises and bewilders me more; for knowing that He 
has such love I already understand that there is no exaggeration in the words by which He reveals it to us, for He has shown 
this love even more through his deeds. But when you reach this 
place in my writing, I ask you that for love of me you pause a 
little to think upon what He has shown us and what He has suffered for us, observing clearly that a love so powerful and 
strong that it made Him suffer so much could not reveal itself 
in words that should be any surprise to us.

    </p>
    <p>
8. Well now, to return to what I began saying, these words 
must contain great things and mysteries since they are of such 
value that when I asked learned men to explain what the Holy 
Spirit meant by them and what the true meaning was they 
answered that the doctors wrote many commentaries and yet 
never finished explaining the words fully. Since this is so, it will 
seem to be excessive pride on my part to want to explain 
something about them for you. It is not my intention, however 
little my humility, to think that I can get to the truth of them. 
What I do intend is that, just as I delight in what the Lord 
gives me understanding of when I hear some passage from the 
<i>Song of Songs</i>, you will perhaps find consolation in it, as I do, 
if I tell you. And I interpret the passage in my own way, even 
though my understanding of it may not be in accord with what 
is meant. For if we do not depart from what the Church and 
the saints hold (which is why learned men who understand the 
matter will examine this carefully before you see it), the Lord 
gives us license — from what I think — just as He does when we 
think of the Passion and consider many more things about the 
anguish and torments the Lord must have suffered than the 
Evangelists record. And if we do not indulge in curiosity, as I 
said at the beginning, but accept the understanding His Majesty gives us, I hold it as certain that we do not offend Him 
when we find delight and consolation in His words and works. 
A king would be happy and pleased if he saw a little shepherd 
he loved looking spellbound at the royal brocade and wondering what it is and how it was made. Nor must we make women 
stand so far away from enjoyment of the Lord's riches. If they 
argue and teach and think they are right without showing their 
writings to learned men; yes, that would be wrong. Consequently, I am not thinking I am right in what I say — the Lord 
knows this well. But as with this little shepherd I mentioned, it 
consoles me to tell my meditations to my daughters; and what I 
tell will contain plenty of foolishness. Thus I begin with the 
favor of my divine King and with the permission of my confessor. May it please His Majesty that as He has wanted me to 
succeed in explaining other things for you — and perhaps He 
did so because they were for you — I might succeed in explaining these. If I don't, I will consider the time well spent that I 
occupy in writing and reflecting upon material so divine that I 
haven't deserved to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
9. It seems to me from what she says in the beginning that 
she is speaking with a third person; and she herself makes it 
known that there are in Christ two natures, one divine and the 
other human. I'm not going to dwell on this, because my intention is to speak about what I think can be beneficial to us who 
engage in prayer; although everything is beneficial for the encouragement and admiration of a soul that ardently loves the 
Lord. His Majesty knows well that even though at times — and 
these were few— I have heard explanations of some of these 
words and have been told their meaning when I asked, I don't 
remember the explanations at all, for I have a very poor 
memory. Thus, I shall be able to say only what the Lord 
teaches me and what serves my purpose; and I don't remember 
ever having heard anything about this first verse. 
    </p>
    <p><i>
      Let Him kiss me with the kiss of His mouth. </i></p>
 
    </p>
    <p>
10. O my Lord and my God, and what words are these that 
a worm speaks them to its Creator! May You be blessed, Lord, 
for in so many ways have You taught us! But who will dare, my 
King, utter these words without Your permission? The thought 
is frightening, and so it will be frightening that I tell anyone to 
utter them. People will say I am a fool, that the words don't 
mean this, that they have many meanings, that obviously we 
must not speak such words to God, that for this reason it is good that simple people do not read these things. I confess that 
the passage has many meanings. But the soul that is enkindled 
with a love that makes it mad desires nothing else than to say 
these words. Indeed, the Lord does not forbid her to say them. </p>
<p>
God help me! Why are we surprised? Isn't the deed more admirable? Do we not approach the most Blessed Sacrament? 
And I was even wondering if the bride was asking for this favor 
that Christ afterward gave us. I also wondered whether she was 
asking for that union so great that God became man, for that 
friendship that he effected with the human race. Obviously a 
kiss is the sign of great peace and friendship among two persons. May the Lord help us understand how many kinds of 
peace there are. 
    </p>
    <p>
11. Before I go any further, and so as not to forget, I want 
to say one thing — very important in my opinion — although the 
matter would fit better at another time. I hold as certain that 
there are many persons who approach the most Blessed Sacrament (and please the Lord I be lying) with serious mortal sins. 
Yet, if such persons were to hear a soul dying with love of its 
God say these words, they would be surprised and consider it 
great boldness. At least I am sure they themselves would <i>Song of 
Songs</i> are said by love. Since such persons have no love, they 
can easily read the <i>Song of Songs </i>every day and not themselves 
become involved with the words; nor would they even dare take 
the words on their lips. For truly even hearing them makes one 
fear, for these words bear in themselves great majesty. How 
much majesty You bear, my Lord, in the most Blessed Sacrament. But since these persons do not have a living faith but a 
dead one, You do not speak to them when they see You so 
humble under the species of bread. They do not deserve to 
hear — and thus they are not so daring. 
    </p>
    <p>
12. As a result these words in themselves, taking them only 
literally, would truly cause fear if the one uttering them were in 
his senses. But the one whom Your love, Lord, has drawn out 
of himself, You will truly pardon if he says them and also 
others, even though to say them is daring. And my Lord, if the 
kiss signifies peace and friendship why shouldn't souls ask You 
for this kiss? What better thing can we ask for than what I ask 
You for, my Lord; that You give me this peace "with the kiss of 
Your mouth"? This, daughters, is a lofty petition, as I shall tell 
you afterward.
    </p>

      <section id="2">

  <h5>  CHAPTER 2</h5>
<p><i>Treats of nine kinds of false peace presented to the soul by the 
world, the flesh, and the devil. Explains the holiness of the 
religious state. This holiness leads to the true peace desired by 
the bride in the </i>Song of Songs. </p>

    <p>
1. GOD DELIVER YOU from the peace of many kinds that 
worldly people have. May He never allow us to try it, for 
it brings perpetual war. When such persons of the world remain quiet, while going about in serious sin, and so tranquil 
about their vices, for their consciences don't feel remorseful 
about anything, their peace, you have read, is a sign that they 
and the devil are friends. While they live, the devil does not 
wage war against them. For bad as they are they would then 
return to God somewhat, not out of love for Him but so as to 
flee from this war. Those who would act in such a way would 
never persevere in serving God. Soon, since the devil 
understands this, he would again give them delight in their 
pleasure and they would return to their friendship with him, 
until he has them in that place where he shows them how false 
their peace was. There is no reason to speak of these persons 
here; let them worry about it, for I hope in the Lord that so 
much evil will not be found among you. But the devil could 
begin to offer you another peace in small things, and always, 
while we live, daughters, we must fear. 
    </p>
    <p>
2. When a Sister begins to grow lax in things that in 
themselves seem small, persisting in them for a long time 
without feeling any remorse of conscience, the resulting peace 
is bad. And consequently the devil can draw her into a thousand evils. Examples of these little things would be an infraction of something in the constitutions, which in itself would not 
be a sin, or being careless, even though without malice, about 
what the bishop commands (in fact he stands in God's place, 
and it is good always — for this reason we have come here — to 
consider what he desires), and many other little things that 
come along and which in themselves do not appear to be sins. 
In sum, there are faults and always will be, for we are 
miserable creatures. I don't say that there are not; what I say is 
that these faults should be felt when they are committed and 
that the soul should understand that there was a fault. For if 
the soul doesn't, the devil, as I say, can rejoice and gradually 
make it insensible to these little things. I tell you, daughters, 
that when the devil attains this, he has attained no small thing, 
for I fear he will go further. Hence, for love of God be very 
careful. There must be war in this life. In the face of so many 
enemies it's not possible for us to sit with our hands folded; 
there must always be this care about how we are proceeding interiorly and exteriorly.
    </p>
    <p>
   3. I tell you that even though in prayer the Lord grants you 
favors and gives you what I shall speak of later, when you 
leave prayer you will meet with a thousand little obstacles, a 
thousand little occasions to break one rule carelessly, or not to 
carry out another well, interior disturbances and temptations. 
I don't say that this war must be going on always or habitually; 
but it is a wonderful favor from the Lord. By this means the 
soul advances. It's impossible for us to be angels here below 
because such is not our nature. In fact, a soul doesn't disturb 
me when I see it with great temptations. If love and fear of our 
Lord are present, the soul will gain very much; I'm certain of 
that. If I see a soul always quiet and without any war — for I've 
run into some like this — I always fear even if I do not see it offending the Lord. Never do I finish seeking to assure myself; 
and trying and tempting such persons, if I can, since the devil 
doesn't do so, in order that they may know themselves. I have 
met a few; to be without war is possible, once the Lord has 
brought the soul to an abundance of contemplation. 
    </p>
    <p>
 4. There is a variety of ways to proceed in prayer. These 
souls I am referring to remain in an habitual and interior happiness. Yet, I think they do not understand themselves. And 
after I take a careful look I see that sometimes they have their 
little wars, though these are few. But it is a fact that I do not 
envy these souls. I have considered the matter attentively and 
see that those who have to fight the war that was mentioned 
advance much further in the things pertaining to perfection, 
without experiencing such abundant prayer, than we can 
understand here below. Let us exclude souls that are far advanced and very mortified after having endured this war for 
many years. Since they are already dead to the world, our Lord 
ordinarily gives them peace, but not in such a way that they 
don't deplore a fault they may commit and experience deep 
sorrow over it.
    </p>
    <p>
   5. Thus, daughters, the Lord leads souls along many paths. 
But always fear, as I have said, when some fault you commit 
does not grieve you. For in regard to sin, even venial, you 
already know that the soul must feel deep sorrow, and, glory to 
God, I believe and see that you do feel it now. 

    </p>
    <p>
   Note one thing, and remember this for love of me: if a person is alive, doesn't he feel a tiny pinprick or a thorn however 
small? Well then, if our souls are not dead but alive in the love 
of God, isn't it a great favor to feel any little thing we do 
against our obligations or what we have professed? Oh, His 
Majesty is making a bed of roses and flowers for Himself in the 
soul to whom He gives this care, and it is impossible that He 
fail to come and favor it, even though late. God help me, what 
are we religious doing in the monastery? Why did we leave the 
world? For what reason did we come? In what better way could 
we be occupied than to prepare rooms within our souls for our 
Spouse and reach the stage in which we can ask Him to give us 
the kiss of His mouth? Happy will be the soul that makes this 
request and whose lamp will not be out when the Lord comes, 4 
otherwise the Lord will grow tired of knocking, and turn away. 
Oh, my daughters! What a great state of life we are in, for no 
one but we ourselves can keep us from saying these words to 
our Spouse since we took Him for our Spouse when we made 
our professions. 
    </p>
    <p>
6. Let scrupulous souls understand me, for I am not speaking of some fault that is committed occasionally or of faults 
that cannot be recognized or always felt by everyone, but of 
one who commits faults habitually without paying any attention to them, thinking they are trifles, and without any 
remorse, and who does not strive to make amends. I repeat 
that peace of this sort is dangerous and you should be warned 
about it. Well now, what will be the peace of those who are 
very lax about the observance of their rule? (Please God there 
will be none.) In many ways the devil will give them peace, for 
God permits him to do so on account of our sins. There is no 
reason to discuss the matter. I wanted to warn you with this 
small comment. Let us go on to the peace and friendship the 
Lord begins to show us in prayer, and I will tell what His Majesty makes known to me. 

    </p>
    <p> 7. But before I do, I think it will be good to tell you a little 
about the peace the world and our own sensuality give. Even 
though in many books this topic has been discussed better than 
I'm capable of doing, perhaps you will not have money to buy 
books, for you are poor, or have any benefactor to give them to 
you. Whereas this writing of mine will remain in the house, 
and you will have all the material together. Souls could in 
many ways be deceived by the peace the world gives. From 
some of these ways that I shall mention you will deduce the 
rest. </p>
<p>8. Oh, as for riches! If people have easily what they need 
and a lot of money in their coffers and guard against committing serious sins, they think everything is done. They enjoy 
what they have. They give an alms from time to time. They do 
not reflect that their riches are not their own but given by the 
Lord so that they, as His stewards, may share their wealth 
among the poor, and that they must give a strict account for 
the time they keep a surplus in their coffers while delaying and 
putting off the poor who are suffering. This topic is not pertinent to us except that you beg the Lord to give rich people 
light that they may not continue in this daze and have happen 
to them what happened to the covetous rich man, and that 
you praise His Majesty because He has made you poor, and 
that you accept poverty as a particular favor from Him. </p>
        <p> 9. Oh, my daughters, what a great relief it is, even with 
respect to our tranquillity here below, not to have these 
burdens; as for the final day, you can't imagine. The rich are 
the slaves and you are the masters. By the following example 
you will see this clearly. Who is more at rest? A gentleman who 
has all he needs to eat on the table and all his clothing laid out 
for him or his steward who must render him an account of 
every penny? The gentleman spends without measure since all 
belongs to him. The poor steward is the one who suffers for it. 
And the more wealth there is the more vigilant the steward has 
to be, for he has to give an accounting. He will especially have 
a large balance to make up if he has held the office for many 
years and has been a little careless. I don't know how he stays 
calm. Don't read this, daughters, without praising our Lord very 
much, and always go forward doing what you are now doing in 
not having any possessions in particular. For without worry we 
eat what the Lord sends since His Majesty takes care that we lack 
nothing. We don't have to give an account of what is left over 
because His Majesty provides in such a way that what is left is so 
small that we are not obliged to share it with others. </p>
        <p>
        10. What is necessary, daughters, is that we be content with 
little. We must not want as much as those who give a strict accounting, as any rich person will have to give, even though he 
may not have to do so here on earth but receives it from his 
stewards. And how strict an accounting he will have to give! If 
he understood he would not eat so happily nor would he spend 
what he has on vanities and trivialities. As for you, daughters, 
look always for the poorest things, which will be enough to get 
by on; in clothing as well as in food. If you don't, you will find 
yourselves frustrated because God is not going to give you 
more, and you will be unhappy. Strive always to serve His Majesty in such a way that you do not eat the food of the poor 
without serving Him for it; although one can only poorly repay 
in service for the calm and repose the Lord gives when there is 
no obligation to account for riches. I well know that you 
understand, but it's necessary that at times you give special 
thanks to His Majesty for riches. </p>
    <p> 
        11. Concerning the peace the world gives through honors, I don't think I have to say anything for you; the poor are never 
honored very much. What can do you great harm is 
praise — for once it starts it never ends — if you are not careful, 
so as to humble yourselves more afterward. The most common 
way will be by telling you that you are saints, in such exaggerated terms that it seems the devil teaches these words. And 
indeed he must sometimes. For if the words were spoken in the 
person's absence, they could be tolerated. But spoken in the 
person's presence, what fruit can they bear? Only harm, if you 
are not very cautious. </p> <p>
            12. For love of God I ask you that you never seek peace for 
yourselves through these words of praise, for little by little they 
could do you harm and make you believe that the truth was 
spoken or make you think that now everything is accomplished 
and that you have done your part. You should never let a word 
of praise pass without it moving you to wage war interiorly, for 
this is easily done if you acquire the habit. Remember how the 
world treated Christ, our Lord, and how they exalted Him on 
Palm Sunday. Look at the esteem it had for St. John the Baptizer, for they wanted to take him for the Messiah, and how 
and why they beheaded him. </p>
            <p>
             13. Never does the world exalt without putting down, if the 
exalted are the sons of God. I have a lot of experience of this. It 
used to afflict me to see so much blindness in these praises, and 
now I laugh to myself as though someone crazy were speaking. 
Remember your sins, and if in some matters people speak the 
truth in praising you, note that the virtue is not yours and that 
you are obliged to serve more. Awaken fear in your soul so that 
you do not rest in the kiss of this false peace given by the world; 
think that it is a kiss from Judas. Although some do not praise 
you with such an intention, the devil is watching to see how he 
can take away the spoils if you do not defend yourselves against 
him. Believe that you have to stand here with a sword in the 
hand of your thoughts. Although you think the praise does you 
no harm, do not trust it. Remember how many were at the top 
and are now at the bottom. There is no security while we are 
alive. For love of God, Sisters, always wage an interior war 
against these praises, for thus you will come away from them with the gain of humility, and the devil and the world who are 
on the lookout for you will be abashed. </p>
             <p> 
             14. Concerning the peace and harm that this security can 
cause in your own flesh, there would be much to say. I shall 
mention some points, and from them, as I have said, you can 
go on to deduce the rest. The flesh is very fond of comfort—you have already seen this. If we could understand we 
would realize that to seek one's peace in comforts is very 
dangerous. I often think about the matter and cannot understand how there can be so much peace and calm in persons 
who live very comfortably. Does the most sacred body of our 
Model and Light perhaps deserve less comfort than our own 
bodies? What did the Lord do to suffer so many trials? Have we 
read in the lives of the saints, those who we know for sure are in 
heaven, that they had a comfortable life? Where does this tranquillity in comfort come from? Who has told us that comfortable living is good? What is this, that some persons spend their 
days eating well and sleeping and seeking recreations and all the 
rest they can? I'm stunned when I consider this. It doesn't seem 
to them there will be another world and they think that the 
things mentioned are the least dangerous of this present world. 
</p>
             <p>
              15. Oh, daughters, if you knew what great evil lies enclosed 
here. The body grows fat and the soul weakens. If we were to 
see the soul, we would think it about ready to expire. In many 
books you will find doctrine written about the great evil found 
in seeking one's peace in comforts, for if we understand that to 
do so is wrong, we will have hope for a remedy. But I fear that 
the thought doesn't pass through peoples' minds. I'm not surprised since the evil is so common. I tell you that even though 
through comforts a person's flesh is at rest, in a thousand ways 
there will be war if such a person is going to be saved. And it 
would be more valuable for souls to understand themselves and 
take up gradually the penance that otherwise will come to 
them all at once. I have said this that you might fervently 
praise God, daughters, that you are in a place where your flesh 
cannot find peace in comforts even though it may want to. 
Such craving for comfort could harm you without your being 
aware, that is, under the excuse of sickness. You need to be 
very careful about this. For one day it will hurt you to take the 
discipline and eight days later perhaps not. Another day or 
number of days you will be unable to bear the coarse tunics, 
but this won't be permanent. Some days eating fish may hurt 
you, but once your stomach gets used to it, it will not harm 
you. Another time you will think you are so weak that you'll be 
unable to go without eating meat, but by not fasting for one 
day you will overcome this weakness. Of these things and of 
much more, I have experience. It shouldn't be thought that 
these things involve serious fault, but that there may not be 
much need for them. What I am saying is that we must not 
find our rest in being lax, but must test ourselves sometimes. I 
know that this flesh is very deceptive and that we need to 
understand it. May the Lord out of His goodness give us light 
for everything. Discretion is very important, as is also trust in 
our superiors rather than in ourselves. </p>
              <p>
              16. To return to our topic; since the bride indicates the 
peace she is seeking by saying,<i> Let Him kiss me with the kiss of 
His mouth</i>, we have a sign that the Lord has other ways of 
bestowing peace and showing friendship. I now want to explain 
some to you so that you will see the kind of lofty petition this is 
and the difference that lies between these two types of peace. </p><p>
O great God and Lord of ours, what profound wisdom! Well 
could the bride have said,<i> let Him kiss me</i>, and, it seems, have 
concluded her petition in fewer words. Why does she specify, 
<i>with the kiss of His mouth?</i> Surely, there is not a letter too 
many. I don't know the reason, but I shall say something about 
this. It matters little if what I say is not what the passage means 
provided, as I said, we benefit from the thoughts. Now then, 
in many ways does our King offer souls peace and friendship, 
as we see each day both in prayer and outside of it; but our 
friendship with His Majesty is only skin-deep, as the saying 
goes. You will observe, daughters, the degree of love you have 
reached in that you will be able to ask for that which the bride 
does if the Lord brings you to Himself. If He doesn't do so, do 
not become discouraged; whatever the friendship you have 
with God, you will be very rich if there is no fault on your part. 
But we should grieve and be very sorry that through our own fault we do not reach this excellent friendship and that we are 
happy with little. </p>
              <p> 17. O Lord, why is it that we do not remember that the 
reward is great and everlasting, and that once we have reached 
such close friendship here below the Lord gives us the reward, 
and that many remain at the foot of the mount who could ascend to the top? In other little things I have written for you I 
have often mentioned this, and now I repeat and ask that you 
always have courageous thoughts. As a result of them the Lord 
will give you grace for courageous deeds. Believe that these 
brave thoughts are important. There are some persons who 
have already attained friendship with the Lord because they 
have confessed their sins well and have repented, but two days 
don't pass before they return to them. Indeed, that is not the 
friendship the bride is asking for. Always strive, O daughters, 
so that you don't go to the confessor each time to confess the 
same fault. </p>
              <p>
               18. It's true that we cannot live without faults, but at least 
there should be some change so that they don't take root. If they 
take root, they will be harder to eradicate and even many 
others could arise from them. If we plant an herb or small tree 
and water it each day, it grows so strong that afterward you 
need a shovel and a pickax to get it out by the roots. Committing the same fault each day, however small, if we do not make 
amends for it, is like watering a plant each day. And if one day 
it is planted and ten more pass by, it can still be easily rooted 
out. In prayer you must ask help from the Lord, for we of 
ourselves can do little; rather, we add faults instead of taking 
them away. Reflect that in that frightful judgment at the hour 
of death we shall see that this was no small matter especially for 
those the Judge took for His brides in this life. </p>
               <p> 19. Oh, great dignity, worthy of awakening us that we 
might try diligently to please this Lord and King of ours! But 
how badly these persons repay this friendship since they turn so 
quickly into mortal enemies! Indeed, how great is the mercy of 
God. Where would we find a friend so patient? And even if a 
friend commits one fault, it is never erased from the other's 
memory, nor do the two manage to have a friendship as trusting as before. Now then, how often will souls similarly fail 
in their friendship with our Lord, and how many years He 
waits for us in this way? May You be blessed, Lord, my God, 
for You show us so much pity that it seems You forget Your 
greatness so as not to punish — as would be right — a betrayal as 
treacherous as this. I think this infidelity is a dangerous state, 
for even though the mercy of God is what it is we also frequently see people dying in this state without confession. May His 
Majesty deliver us, because of who He is, daughters, from being in so dangerous a state.  </p>
               <p>
               20. There is another kind of friendship, stronger than this, 
had by persons who guard themselves against offending the 
Lord mortally. Those who have reached this stage have attained much, the world being what it is. These persons even 
though they guard themselves against sinning mortally do not 
fail to fall now and again, from what I believe. For they care 
little about venial sins; they commit many daily, and thus they 
are very close to committing mortal sins. They will ask: "Do 
you pay attention to that?" Many others I have heard say: 
"That's why we have holy water and the remedies of our holy 
Mother the Church." Such remarks are certainly something to 
grieve over very much. For love of God, take great care never to 
grow careless about venial sin, however small, by recalling that 
we have a remedy. It is not right that something good be the 
occasion for doing wrong. To be mindful of this remedy after 
the fact and to strive to use it at once is, of course, good.  </p>
               <p> 21. It is a very important thing always to have a conscience 
so pure that nothing hinders you from asking our Lord for the 
perfect friendship the bride asks for. At least, the kind of 
friendship we just mentioned is not the one the bride asks for. 
That friendship just mentioned is truly suspect for many 
reasons. And those given over to comforts and prepared for 
much lukewarmness will not know clearly whether what they 
do is a venial or mortal sin. God deliver us from this lukewarmness. Since it seems to them that they do not commit the serious 
sins they see in others — and such is not the state of perfect 
humility — they judge these others to be wicked. It could be 
that these latter are much better because they weep over their sins with deep repentance and, perhaps, with a better purpose 
of amendment, which will result in their never offending the 
Lord in little or much. Those doing the judging, since it seems 
to them they don't do any of these bad things, give themselves 
greater latitude for their enjoyments. For the most part, they 
will recite their vocal prayers, but not very well, because their 
consciences are not so delicate.  <p>
               22. There is another kind of friendship and peace our Lord 
begins to give some persons who are totally committed to not 
offending Him in anything, although they don't withdraw so 
much from the occasions. They have their times for prayer. 
Our Lord gives them tenderness and tears. Yet, they do not 
want to give up the enjoyments of this life. They want to live a 
good and well-ordered life, for they think it is beneficial for 
them to live here below with tranquillity. Life bears with it 
many changes. They will be doing enough if they continue in 
the practice of virtue. But if they don't withdraw from the 
satisfactions and pleasures of the world, they will soon grow lax 
again in walking the Lord's path; there are great enemies we 
must defend ourselves against. Such, daughters, is not the 
friendship the bride desires; neither should you desire it. Turn 
away always from any little occasion, however small, if you 
want the soul to grow and live securely.  </p>
               <p>
               23. I don't know why I'm saying these things to you unless 
so that you will understand the dangers that lie in not turning 
resolutely from all worldly things. For if we do turn from them 
we will spare ourselves many faults and trials. There are so 
many ways in which our Lord begins to exchange friendship 
with souls that I don't think I would ever finish recounting the 
ones I've recognized, even though I am a woman. What would 
confessors or those who deal with them more particularly have 
to say? Indeed, some of those persons bewilder me, for it seems 
they have everything that is required for them to be friends of 
God. I shall tell you about one lady in particular, for it is not 
long ago that I spoke with her in a special way. She was very 
fond of receiving Communion frequently, never said anything 
bad about anyone, experienced devotion in her prayer, and lived in constant solitude because she was in her house by 
herself. She was so mild in her temperament that nothing said 
to her ever made her angry or say any bad word, for she was 
quite perfect. She had never married, nor was she now at an 
age in which she could, and she had undergone many contradictions along with having this peace. Since I saw all these 
virtues, it seemed to me they were effects of a very advanced 
soul and of deep prayer. And I esteemed this lady highly at the 
beginning because I didn't see her offend God and understood 
that she guarded against doing so. </p>
               <p>
               24. After getting to know her I began to understand that all 
was peaceful as long as her self-interest was not affected. But 
when her own interests were at stake, her conscience was not so 
delicate, but actually easygoing. I learned that although she 
would suffer all the things that were said against her, she would 
not tolerate anything said against her reputation even in some 
tiny point concerning her honor or the esteem she thought was 
her due. She was so overcome by this misery, so eager to know 
everything that was said against these and so fond of her comfort that I was amazed how such a person could live even an 
hour. She embellished all this in such a way that it appeared 
free from sin. And taking into account the reasons she gave to 
justify some of her actions I think I would have tried to defend 
her if someone had blamed her. In other things it was quite ob- 
vious that she was wrong though perhaps this judgment came 
from not understanding her motives well. I was really 
bewildered. Almost everyone considered her to be a saint, 
although I observed that she must have been somewhat at fault 
for the persecutions she underwent. And I did not envy her 
manner of living and sanctity. Rather, she and two other souls 
that I have seen in this life — for now I recall them — who were 
saints in their own opinion, caused me more fear, after I spoke 
with them, than all the sinners I have seen. I beg the Lord to 
give us light.  </p>
               <p>
                25. Praise Him, daughters, very much for He brought you to 
the monastery where, however much the devil may do, we cannot be deceived as much as can those who live in their own 
homes. There are souls whom, it seems, nothing keeps from flying off to heaven; they seek perfection in every thing — in their 
opinion. But there is no one to inform them of their faults. In 
monasteries I have never seen this lack, for souls must do, not 
what they want, but what they are told. Instead, people living 
in their own homes cannot know their faults, even though they 
would like to because they want to please the Lord. For, in the 
end, what they do is their own will. And even though they may 
go against their own will sometimes, they do not exercise 
themselves so much in mortification. Let us exclude some persons to whom our Lord has given light for many years, for these 
persons seek someone who will inform them of their faults and 
to whom they may submit, and their great humility leads them 
to have little confidence in themselves, however learned they 
may be. <p>

  26. There are others who have left everything for the Lord 
and have neither house nor possessions, nor do they take 
pleasure in comfort — on the contrary, they are penitential — or 
in the things of the world, because the Lord has already given 
them light about how miserable these things are. But they are 
too attached to their honor. They would not want to do 
anything that was not really acceptable to men as well as to the 
Lord; great discretion and prudence. It is not always easy to 
reconcile these two, for the trouble is that without one's being 
aware the interests of the world almost always gain more than 
do those of God. These souls, for the most part, grieve over 
anything said against them. They do not embrace the cross but 
drag it along, and so it hurts and wearies them and breaks 
them to pieces. However, if the cross is loved, it is easy to bear; 
this is certain. </p><p>
                27. No, neither is this the friendship the bride seeks. As a 
result, my daughters, since you have done what I mentioned 
here first, be careful not to let yourself be overcome by the second thing. Everything should be wearisome to you; if you 
have given up the most (you have left the world, its comforts, 
joys, and riches, which, even though false, in the end are pleasing) what do you fear? Look how you fail to understand, for in 
order to free yourselves from some bitterness a word can cause 
you, you burden yourselves with a thousand worries and obligations. There are so many of these, if we want to please 
those who are in the world, that one can't bear mentioning 
them all or enlarging upon them, nor would I even know how. </p>
                <p> 28. There are other souls, and in speaking of them I'm going to conclude, for if you pay attention to what I have said you 
will understand many ways by which they begin to make progress and then falter on the road. I say "there are other souls," 
because no longer are they concerned about what people say or 
about their own honor. But these souls are not exercised in 
mortification and in denying their own will, and so they never 
get over their fear. Since they are determined to suffer everything, it may seem that the job is done. But in serious matters 
concerning the honor of the Lord their concern for their own 
honor revives. Yet, they don't seem to understand. They think 
they don't fear the world but fear God. They figure out how 
dangers might arise in that virtuous deeds could result in much 
evil. It seems the devil teaches them; a thousand years in advance they prophesy what could come, if doing so is necessary.  </p> 
                <p> 29. These are not souls of the kind that would do what St. 
Peter did, by throwing himself into the sea, or what many 
other saints did. In their calm they will draw souls to the Lord, 
but not by putting themselves in dangers. Nor does the faith 
they have do much for them in their efforts to carry out their 
resolutions with deeds. One thing I have noticed; we see few in 
the world, outside of religious life, entrust their livelihood to 
God. I know only two persons. In religious life it is already 
known that there will be no lack — although whoever truly 
enters for God alone, I believe, will not think of this. But how 
many there are, daughters, who will not give up what they 
have unless it be with security! In other writings where I have 
given you advice, I have spoken much about these 
pusillanimous souls and mentioned the harm their faintheartedness does them and how good it is for them to have 
great desires since they cannot do great works. I don't say any 
more about these, although I would never tire of doing so. 
Once the Lord brings them to so great a state, let them serve 
Him through it, and not be shy. For even if someone who is a 
religious — especially a woman — cannot help her neighbor, her 
prayer will be powerful if she has strong determination and ardent desires for souls. Even, perhaps, the Lord will desire that 
either in life or in death she will help others, as the holy friar 
Diego does now. He was a lay brother and did nothing more 
than serve; and after his death, so many years ago, his memory 
is revived by the Lord that he might be an example to us. Let 
us praise His Majesty! 
 </p> <p>30. Thus, my daughters, if the Lord has brought you to this 
state, little is lacking for you to receive the peace and friendship the bride asks for. Don't fail to beg the Lord for it with 
continual tears and desires. Do what you can for your part that 
He might give it to you. Realize that the religious state itself is 
not the peace and friendship the bride asks for, even though 
the Lord grants a great favor to the one He has brought to it. 
For only after one has been occupied in much prayer, penance, 
humility, and many other virtues, will that peace come. May 
the Lord always be praised for He gives all, amen. </p>
         <section id="3">

  <h5>  CHAPTER 3 </h5>

    <p><i>Treats of the true peace God grants the soul and of His union 
with it. Gives some examples of the heroic charity of some servants of God. </p><p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Let Him kiss me with the kiss of His mouth. 
(Sg 1:2) </p></i>
    <p>
    1. O HOLY BRIDE, let us turn to what you ask for: that holy 
peace which makes the soul, while remaining itself completely secure and tranquil, venture out to war against all 
worldly kinds of peace. Oh, how happy will be the lot of one 
who obtains this favor since it is a union with the will of God; 
such a union that there is no division between Him and the 
soul, but one same will. It is a union not based on words or 
desires alone, but a union proved by deeds. Thus, when the 
bride knows she is serving the Bridegroom in something, there 
is so much love and desire to please Him that she doesn't listen 
to the reasons the intellect will give her or to the fears it will 
propose. But she lets faith so work that she doesn't look for her 
own profit or rest; rather, she succeeds now in understanding 
that in this service lies all her profit. 
    </p>
    <p>
   2.  It will seem to you, daughters, that this way of acting is 
not advisable, since doing things with discretion is so 
praiseworthy a practice. You must keep in mind one point: the 
Lord has heard your petition (from what you can understand, I 
mean, for one cannot know with certainty) that He kiss you 
with the kiss of His mouth. For if you know this through the effects of His having done so, there is no reason to delay in 
anything; but forget yourselves so as to please this most sweet 
Bridegroom. His Majesty gives many signs of Himself to those 
who enjoy this favor. One sign is contempt for all earthly 
things, in which they are judged to be as little as they in fact 
are. Another, not desiring one's own good, because one's own 
vanity is already understood. A third, not rejoicing except with 
those who love their Lord. Life becomes wearisome to these 
persons; their esteem is for the riches they merit. And there are 
other similar signs that He who placed them in this state 
teaches. 
    </p>
    <p>
    3. Once the soul has arrived here, it has nothing to fear except that God may not make use of it by giving it trials and the 
occasions for serving Him even at a great cost to itself. Hence, 
as I've said, 1 love and faith are at work. And the soul does not 
want to benefit by what the intellect teaches it, for this union 
between the bride and Bridegroom has taught it other things 
the intellect cannot attain to, and the soul tramples the in- 
tellect underfoot. </p><p>

Let us draw a comparison so that you may understand. 
There is a captive in the land of the Moors whose father is 
poor, but who has a good friend. If this friend doesn't ransom 
him, the captive has no means of liberation. What his friend 
possesses is not enough to pay the ransom, but the friend will 
have to go to serve in the captive's place. The great love the 
friend has makes him want freedom for the captive more than 
for himself. But then discretion comes along with many reasons 
and tells the friend that he is more obligated to himself and 
that he perhaps has less fortitude than the one who is now in 
captivity and that the Moors will make him lose his faith, that 
it is not good to place oneself in this danger, and many other 
things.
    </p>
    <p>
  4.  Oh, strong love of God! And how true it is that nothing 
seems impossible to the one who loves! Oh, happy the soul that 
has obtained this peace from its God, for it is master over all 
the trials and dangers of the world, fears no one provided it 
serves so good a Spouse and Lord. Its reason to love Him is far 
greater than the reason the father and friend have for loving 
the captive. Well, daughters, you've already read about a saint 
who when a widow came to him in desolation went to the land 
of the Moors to exchange himself for her son. 2 He did this not 
for a son or for a friend but because he must have truly arrived 
at this blessed state in which God must have given him this 
peace and so that he could please His Majesty and somehow 
imitate Him. You've also read how things turned out and how 
spiritually enriched this saint was when he returned from 
captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
5. [I would think that his mind did not fail to come up with 
some more reasons besides those I mentioned, because he was a 
bishop and would have had to abandon his flock, and perhaps 
he would have had fears. Consider one thing that comes to me 
now and is appropriate for those who are pusillanimous and 
weak in spirit — for the most part they will be women. Although 
in truth their souls may have reached this state, their weak 
nature fears. It's necessary for us to be on guard because this 
natural weakness will make us lose a great crown. When you 
feel this pusillanimity, have recourse to faith and humility, and 
don't fail to go on fighting with faith, for God can do all. Thus 
He was able to give fortitude to many saintly girls, and He gave 
it so that they were able to suffer many torments, since they 
were determined to suffer for Him. 
    </p>
    <p>
    6. By means of this determination in the soul, the Lord 
desires to make it master of its own free will, for in no way does 
He need our strength. Rather, His Majesty enjoys having His 
works shine forth in weak people, for in them there is more 
room for His power to work and fulfill the desire He has to 
grant us favors. As a result, the virtues God has given you will help you act with determination and forget the reasons the intellect presents and your own weakness. These virtues will prevent this weakness from increasing when there are thoughts 
about what will or will not happen or thoughts, perhaps, that 
because of my own sins I will not deserve that He give me the 
fortitude He has given others. This isn't the time to think about 
your sins; leave them aside, as I have said. Such humility is inopportune right now and comes at the worst moment. 
    </p>
    <p>
      7.When others desire to give you something very honorable 
or when the devil incites you to a comfortable life or to other 
similar things, be afraid lest because of your sins you will not be 
able to bear these things with rectitude. And when you have to 
suffer something for our Lord or for your neighbor, do not be 
afraid of your sins. You could perform one of these works with 
so much charity that all your sins would be pardoned. The 
devil fears this, and that's why he reminds you of your sins at 
such a time. Be certain that the Lord will never fail His lovers, 
when they take a risk for Him alone. What they should watch 
out for are other selfish intentions, for I am not speaking except of those who aim after pleasing the Lord with the greatest 
perfection.]</p><p>
    8. And now in our times, I know a person — and you have 
seen him for he came to see me — who was moved by the Lord 
with such great charity that it cost him many tears not to be 
able to go in exchange for a captive. He spoke of the matter to 
me — he was one of the discalced followers of Friar Peter of 
Alcantara — and after many urgent entreaties got the permission from his Father General. And when he was four leagues 
from Argel — about to realize his good desire — the Lord 
brought him to Himself. Surely he received a good reward. 
Well now how many discreet persons there were who told him 
his idea was crazy! For those of us who have not reached such 
love of God, it may seem so. And how much crazier it will be to 
come to the end of the dream that is this life with so much 
common sense! Please God we will merit to enter heaven; and, 
what is more, to be numbered among those who have advanced so far in the love of God. 
    </p>
    <p>
9. Now I realize that God's great help is necessary for things like this. Consequently, I counsel you, daughters, always to ask 
with the bride for this peace that is so delightful. With it the 
soul will reign over all these little fears of the world. And 
peacefully and quietly the soul will conquer the world. Isn't it 
clear that the soul to whom God grants so great a favor as to 
join it with Himself in a friendship like this will be left truly 
rich in His blessings? For certainly these things cannot be ours. 
We can ask and desire that He grant us this favor — and even 
the asking is done with His help. As for the rest, what power 
has a worm? Sin keeps it so cowardly and miserable that all the 
virtues we can imagine are appraised according to our lowly 
nature. 
    </p>
    <p>
Well then, what is the remedy, daughters? To ask for what 
the bride asks for. If a peasant girl should marry the king and 
have children, don't the children have royal blood? Well, if our 
Lord grants so much favor to our soul that He joins Himself to 
it in this inseparable way, what desires, what effects, what 
heroic deeds will be born from it as offspring, if the soul be not 
at fault! 
    </p>
    <p>
10. [Hence I repeat that in similar cases if the Lord should 
grant you the favor of offering you something to be done for 
Him that you pay no attention to the fact that you have been 
sinners. It is necessary here that faith master our misery and 
that you be not frightened if at the beginning in making the 
resolution, and even afterward, you feel fear and weakness. 
Pay no attention to these except to encourage yourselves more; 
don't interfere with the flesh. Behold what the good Jesus says 
in His prayer in the garden,<i> the flesh is weak; </i> and remember 
His admirable and sorrowful sweat. Now then, if His Majesty 
says that the divine and sinless flesh is weak, how is it we desire 
our flesh to be so strong that it doesn't feel the persecutions and 
the trials that can come to it? And in these very trials the flesh 
will be as though subject to the spirit. When the soul's will is 
joined to the will of God, the flesh does not complain. 
    </p>
    <p>
11. The thought comes to me now that our good Jesus 
showed us the weakness of His humanity previous to the trials, 
and when He was in the abyss of His sufferings showed such 
great fortitude that He not only did not complain but did nothing that would make it appear He was suffering with 
weakness. When He went to the garden, He said: <i> My soul is 
sorrowful even to death.</i>  Yet, while on the cross, for He was 
already suffering death, He did not complain. Nor did He do 
so when in the prayer of the garden He went to awaken His 
apostles. With greater reason might He have complained to 
His Mother and our Lady when she was at the foot of the cross, 
and not asleep but suffering in her most holy soul and dying a 
harsh death; it always consoles us more to complain to those 
who we know feel our trials and love us more. 
    </p>
    <p>
12. So, let's not complain of fears or become discouraged at 
seeing our nature weak and without strength. Let us strive to 
strengthen ourselves with humility and understand clearly the 
little we ourselves can do and that if God does not favor us, we 
are nothing. Let us distrust completely our own strength and 
confide in His mercy, and until we attain this mercy our 
weakness will persist. Not without reason did our Lord show us 
His weakness, for it is clear that He was not weak since He was 
fortitude itself. But He did so for our consolation and that we 
might understand how it is fitting for us to carry out our desires 
with deeds. Let us observe that when the soul begins to mortify 
itself, everything is painful to it. If it begins to give up comforts, it grieves; if it must give up honor, it feels torment; and if 
it must suffer an offensive word, the hurt becomes intolerable 
for it. In sum, there are never lacking sorrows for it until 
death. But as it succeeds in its determination to die to the 
world, it will find itself freed of these sufferings; and, on the 
contrary, there will be no fear of its complaining any longer, 
for the peace the bride asks for will have been attained.]
    </p>
    <p>
13.  Certainly, I think that if we were to approach the most 
Blessed Sacrament with great faith and love, once would be 
enough to leave us rich. How much richer from approaching so 
many times as we do. The trouble is we do so out of routine, 
and it shows. O miserable world, you have so covered the eyes 
of those who live in you that they do not see the treasures by 
which they could win everlasting riches! 
    </p>
<p>14. O Lord of heaven and earth, how is it possible that even 
while in this mortal life one can enjoy You with so special a friendship, that the Holy Spirit says this so clearly in these 
words, and that still we do not want to understand that these 
are the delights You share with souls in this <i>Song of Songs! </i>
What endearing words! What sweetness! One of these words 
would have been enough for us to be dissolved in You. May 
You be blessed, Lord, because we don't lose anything through 
Your fault. Along how many paths, in how many ways, by how 
many methods You show us love! With trials, with a death so 
harsh, with torments, suffering offenses every day and then 
pardoning; and not only with these deeds do You show this 
love, but with words so capable of wounding the soul in love 
with You that You say them in this <i>Song of Songs </i>and teach the 
soul what to say to You. For I don't know how the words can be 
endured if You do not help the one who hears them to bear 
them — because of our weakness, not because of what the words 
deserve. 
    </p>
    <p>
    15. Hence, my Lord, I do not ask You for anything else in 
life but that <i>You kiss me with the kiss of Your mouth,</i> and that 
You do so in such a way that although I may want to withdraw 
from this friendship and union, my will may always, Lord of 
my life, be subject to Your will and not depart from it; that 
there be nothing to impede me from being able to say: "My 
God and my Glory, indeed <i>Your breasts are better and more 
delightful than wine.</i>"
    </p>
             <section id="4">

  <h5>  CHAPTER 4 </h5>
    <p><i>Speaks of the prayer of quiet and of union and of the sweetness 
and delight they cause in the spirit; in comparison, earthly 
delights are nothing. 

&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour breasts are better than wine, and give 
forth the most sweet fragrance. (Sg. 1:2-3) </i></p><p>
1. 
OH, MY DAUGHTERS, what deep secrets there are in these 
words! May the Lord give us experience of them, for they 
are very difficult to explain. </p><p>
  When His Majesty, through His mercy, desires to answer the 
petition of the bride, He begins to commune with the soul in so 
friendly a way that only those who experience this friendship 
will understand it, as I say. I have written much about this in 
two books (which, if the Lord is pleased, you will see after my 
death) in a very detailed way and at length, for I see that you 
will need them. Thus, I will do no more here than touch upon 
the matter. I don't know whether I will succeed in using the 
same words by which the Lord wished to explain the matter 
there. 
    </p>
    <p>
    
    2. In the interior of the soul a sweetness is felt so great that 
the soul feels clearly the nearness of its Lord. This experience is 
not merely one of devotion moving a person to shed many 
tears — which give satisfaction — either by thinking of the Passion of the Lord or of our sins. In this prayer of which I speak, 
that I call "quiet" because of the calm caused in all the 
faculties (for it seems the person has them well under control—although sometimes the experience is not like this, 
because the soul is not so absorbed in this sweetness), it seems 
that the whole man interiorly and exteriorly is comforted. It's 
as though there were poured into the marrow of one's bones a 
sweet ointment with a powerful fragrance. If we were suddenly 
to enter a place where this fragrance was strong and not from 
one thing but from many, and we did not know what it was or 
where it came from except that it permeated everything, we 
would have some idea of this most sweet love of our God. He 
enters the soul and does so with wonderful sweetness. He 
pleases and makes it happy, and it cannot understand how or 
from where that blessing enters. It would not want to lose that 
good; it would not want to stir or speak or even look lest the 
blessing go away. 
    </p>
    <p>
3. [And this is what the bride says here according to my interpretation, that the breasts of the Bridegroom give forth 
fragrance greater than that of precious ointments.] </p><p>

  In these books I mentioned I spoke of what the soul must do 
in order to make progress, and my purpose here is solely to explain the type of prayer I am dealing with. Thus, I do not want 
to enlarge any more than to say that in this friendship (for the Lord now shows the soul that He loves it in so particular a way 
that there is nothing separating the two) great truths are communicated to the soul. For this light that dazzles the soul, since 
it is not understood, makes one see the vanity of the world. The 
soul doesn't see the good Master who teaches it, although it 
understands that He is with it. But it is left so well instructed, 
with such great effects and fortitude in the virtues, that it 
doesn't know itself afterward; nor would it want to do or say 
anything other than praise the Lord. While in this joy it is so 
enwrapped and absorbed that it doesn't seem to be within itself 
but in a kind of divine intoxication so that it doesn't know what 
it wants or what it says or what it asks for. In sum, it doesn't 
know itself; but it isn't outside itself to the extent that it fails to 
understand something of what is going on. 
    </p>
    <p>
 4.  But when this most wealthy Bridegroom desires to enrich 
and favor the soul more, He changes it into Himself to such a 
point that, just as a person is caused to swoon from great 
pleasure and happiness, it seems to the soul it is left suspended 
in those divine arms, leaning on that sacred side and those 
divine breasts. It doesn't know how to do anything more than 
rejoice, sustained by the divine milk with which its Spouse is 
nourishing it and making it better so that He might favor it, 
and it might merit more each day.
    </p>
    <p>
When it awakens from that sleep and that heavenly inebriation, it remains as though stupefied and dazed and with a holy 
madness. It seems to me it can say these words:<i> Your breasts 
are better than wine.</i> </p>
    <p>
While it was in that intoxication, the soul thought it had no 
farther to ascend. But when it saw itself in a higher degree and 
completely drenched in the countless grandeurs of God, and 
sustained in this way, it makes a delicate comparison and says: 
<i>Your breasts are better than wine</i>. 
    </p>
    <p>
An infant doesn't understand how it grows nor does it know 
how it gets its milk, for without its sucking or doing anything, 
often the milk is put into its mouth. Likewise, here, the soul is 
completely ignorant. It knows neither how nor from where that 
great blessing came to it, nor can it understand. It knows that 
the blessing is the greatest that can be tasted in life, even if all the delights and pleasures of the world were joined together. It 
sees that it is nourished and made better and doesn't know 
when it deserved this. It is instructed in great truths without 
seeing the Master who teaches it; fortified in virtues and 
favored by One who knows it well and can do these things for 
it. It doesn't know what to compare His grace to, unless to the 
great love a mother has for her child in nourishing and caressing it. 
    </p>
    <p>
5. [This comparison is appropriate. For the soul is so 
elevated and beyond the ability to benefit from its intellect, 
that it is, in part, like an infant that delights in a caress but 
doesn't have an intellect by which to understand how that good 
comes. For in the sleep coming from the divine inebriation the 
soul is still functioning because it understands and does 
something. It understands that it is near its God, and thus it 
has reason for saying: <i>Your breasts are better than wine.</i> 
    </p>
    <p>
6. Great is this favor, my Spouse; a pleasing feast. Precious 
wine do You give me, for with one drop alone You make me 
forget all of creation and go out from creatures and myself, so 
that I will no longer want the joys and comforts that my sensuality desired up until now. Great is this favor; I did not 
deserve it. 
    </p>
    <p>
After His Majesty granted it a greater favor and brought it 
closer to Himself, it rightly says: <i>Your breasts are better than 
wine.</i> The past favor was a great one, my God, but much 
greater is this one because I do less in it, and thus it is in every 
way better. The joy and delight of the soul are great when it arrives here.]     </p>
    <p>
   
7. Oh, my daughters, may our Lord give us understanding 
or, to put it better, a taste — for there is no other way of being 
able to understand — of what the soul's joy is in this state. Let 
worldly people worry about their lordships, riches, delights, 
honors, and food, for even if a person were able to enjoy all 
these things without the accompanying trials — which is im- 
possible—he would not attain in a thousand years the hap- 
piness that in one moment is enjoyed by a soul brought here by 
the Lord. St. Paul says, <i>all the trials of the world are not wor- 
thy to be compared with the glory which we await.</i> I say that in addition they are not worthy nor can they merit even one 
hour of this satisfaction, joy, and delight given here by God to 
the soul. There is no comparison between this delight and the 
baseness of worldly things, in my opinion. Nor can one merit so 
delightful a favor from our Lord, so intimate a union, or a love 
so destined to be experienced and felt. How ridiculous it would 
be to compare the trials of worldly people with those suffered 
here by the soul. If trials are not suffered for God, they are 
worth nothing; if they are suffered for Him, His Majesty adapts 
them to our strength. Thus, if we are so afraid of them it is 
because we are fainthearted and miserable. 
    </p>
    <p>
8. Oh, Christians and my daughters! Let us now, for love of 
the Lord, awake from this sleep and behold that He does not 
keep the reward of loving Him for the next life alone. The pay 
begins in this life. O my Jesus, who could explain the benefit 
that lies in throwing ourselves into the arms of this Lord of ours 
and making an agreement with His Majesty that <i> I look at my 
Beloved, and my Beloved at me,</i> and that He look after my 
things and I look after His! Let's not, as the saying goes, love 
ourselves to death. I repeat, my God, and beg You through the 
blood of your Son that You grant me this favor:<i> Let Him kiss 
me with the kiss of His mouth,</i> for without You, what am 
I, Lord? If I am not close to You, what am I worth? If I stray a 
little from Your Majesty, where will I end up? 
    </p>
    <p>

   
    9. Oh, my Lord, my Mercy, and my Good! And what 
greater good could I want in this life than to be so close to You, 
that there be no division between You and me? With this companionship, what can be difficult? What can one not undertake for You, being so closely joined? What is there in me to be 
grateful for, my Lord? Rather, I must blame myself very much 
for my failure to serve You. And thus I beg You, with St. 
Augustine, and with full determination, that You "give me 
what You command and command what You will." Never, 
with Your favor and help, will I turn my back on You. </p>


<p> 10.Now I see, my Bridegroom, that <i>You are mine.</i> I cannot deny it. You came into the world for me; for me You 
underwent severe trials; for me You suffered many lashes; for 
me You remain in the most Blessed Sacrament; and now You grant me so many wonderful favors. Well then, O most holy 
bride, with what ardor I have said what you say: "What can I 
do for my Spouse?"</p>
<p>11. [Indeed, Sisters, I don't know how to go on from here. 
How can I be Yours, my God? What can one who has used so 
unskillfully the favors You have granted do for You? What can 
be expected of her services? Since with Your help she does 
something, consider what a poor worm will be able to do. Why 
does a Lord so powerful need her? Oh, love! How I would want 
to say this word everywhere because love alone is that which 
can dare say with the bride, / am my Beloved's. He gives us 
permission to think that He, this true Lover, my Spouse and 
my Good, needs us. </p>

<p>12. Since He gives us permission, let us repeat, daughters, 
<i>my Beloved is mine and I am my Beloved's.</i> You are mine, 
Lord? If You come to me, why do I doubt that I will be able to 
serve You? From here on, Lord, I want to forget myself and 
look only at how I can serve You and have no other desire than 
to do Your will. But my desire is not powerful, my God; You 
are the powerful One. What I can do is be determined; thus 
from this very moment I am determined to serve You through 
deeds.] </p>

           <section id="5">

  <h5>  CHAPTER 5</h5><p>

   <i> Continues to deal with the prayer of union and tells of the 
riches the soul acquires in it through the mediation of the Holy 
Spirit. Tells of the souls determination to suffer trials for the 
Beloved. </p>

<p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI sat down under the shadow of Him whom I 
desired and His fruit is sweet to my taste. (Sg. 
2:3) </i></p>
   <p> 1. NOW LET US question the bride. Let us learn from this 
blessed soul that has approached the divine mouth and 
been sustained by these heavenly breasts; and we shall learn 
from it further what we must do, how we must act, what we 
must say if the Lord is to bring us sometime to the experience 
of this wonderful favor. 
    </p>
    
      <p>
2. What she tells us is: <i> I sat down under the shadow of Him 
whom I desired and His fruit is sweet to my taste. The King 
brought me into the wine cellar and set charity in order in me.</i> 
She says,<i> I sat down under the shadow of Him whom I desired. </i>
God help me, how exposed to the sun, and burned by it, is the 
soul! She says she sat under the shadow of Him whom she 
desired. Here she compares Him to the apple tree, and she says 
its fruit is sweet to her taste. O souls that practice prayer, taste 
all these words! How many ways there are of thinking about our 
God. How different the kinds of food we can make from Him! 
He is manna, for the taste we get from Him conforms to the 
taste we prefer. Oh, what heavenly shade this is! And who 
could say what the Lord reveals from it! I recall what the angel 
said to the most Blessed Virgin, our Lady:<i> the power of the 
Most High will overshadow you. </i> How fortified will a soul be 
when the Lord places it in this grandeur! Rightly can it sit 
down and be assured. 
      </p>
      <p>
3. Now note that for the most part, and almost always, God 
gives these sublime gifts and great favors to persons who have 
labored much in His service and desired His love and striven to 
prepare themselves so that in all things they might be agreeable 
to His Majesty. There may be some exception when the Lord 
wishes to give some person a special call, as He did St. Paul, for 
He brought him at once to the peak of contemplation and appeared to him and spoke in such a way that immediately that 
saint was truly exalted. But when souls are worn out from 
many years of meditation and of having sought this 
Bridegroom, and most weary of worldly things, they sit under 
the shadow of Truth, they do not seek their comfort or calm or 
rest anywhere except where they understand they can truly 
have it. They place themselves under the protection of the 
Lord; they desire no other. And how well they are acting by 
trusting in His Majesty; for just as they have desired, they sit 
under His shadow. Fortunate is the soul that merits to remain 
under this shadow even from the viewpoint of things that can 
be seen here below! In regard to things the soul alone can understand — that's something else as I have often realized.
      </p>
      <p>
       4. It seems that while the soul is in this delight that was 
mentioned it feels itself totally engulfed and protected in this 
shadow and kind of cloud of the Divinity. From it come inspirations and a delightful dew which indeed rightly takes away 
the weariness that worldly things have caused the soul. The 
soul feels there a kind of repose that will even make breathing 
wearisome to it. And the faculties are so quiet and calm that 
the will would not want them to admit any thoughts, even good 
ones, nor does it admit any by way of inquiry or striving after 
them. There's no need to move the hand or raise it — I'm referring to reflection — for anything, for the Lord gives from the 
apple tree (to which she compares her Beloved) the fruit 
already cut, cooked, and even chewed. So she says that <i>His 
fruit is sweet to her taste.</i> For in this prayer all the soul does is 
taste, without any work on the part of the faculties; and present in this shadow of the Divinity — well does she say 
"shadow," since we cannot see It clearly here below but only 
under this cloud — is that brilliant Sun. This Sun sends, by 
means of love, the knowledge that His Majesty is indescribably 
close. I know that anyone who has undergone this experience 
will understand how truly this meaning can be given to these 
words spoken by the bride. 

      </p>
      <p>
       5. It seems to me the Holy Spirit must be a mediator between the soul and God, the One who moves it with such ardent desires, for He enkindles it in a supreme fire, which is so 
near. O Lord, how great are these mercies You show to the soul 
here! May You be blessed and praised forever, for You are so 
good a Lover. O my God and my Creator! Is it possible that 
there is no one who loves You? Oh, alas, and how often it is I 
who do not love You! Why didn't I merit to know You? How 
low do the branches of this divine apple tree reach, so that at 
times the soul may take hold of them by reflecting upon the 
grandeurs and multitude of mercies shown to it, and that it 
might see and enjoy the fruit that Jesus Christ, our Lord, drew 
from His Passion, watering this tree with His precious blood, 
with so admirable a love. 
      </p>
      <p>
Previously, the soul says, it enjoyed sustenance from his divine breasts. As a beginner in receiving these favors the soul was 
nourished by the Bridegroom. Now it is growing, and He is 
enabling it to receive more. He nourishes it with apples. He 
wants it to understand how it is obliged to serve and suffer. 
And the Lord is not content with all this — something 
marvelous, worthy of careful attention — for He understands 
that the soul is totally His, without any other interests. This 
means that things must not move it because of what they are, 
but that it be moved because of who its God is and out of love 
for Him, since He never ceases to commune with it in so many 
ways and manners, as One who is Wisdom itself. 
      </p>
      <p>
6. In the first kind of peace, it seemed that no more could 
be given, yet this favor that was just mentioned is a much more 
sublime one. It is badly explained because my only intention is 
to note it briefly. In the book I mentioned to you, daughters, 
you will find — if the Lord wills that it be published — the favor 
explained much more clearly. Well now, what more could we 
desire than this favor just mentioned? Oh, God help me, how 
little we desire to reach Your grandeurs, Lord! How miserable 
we would remain if Your giving were in conformity with our 
asking! Now let us consider what the bride said further on. 
      </p>
 
         <section id="6">

  <h5>  CHAPTER 6</h5>
      <p><i>Treats of how the benefits of this loving union surpass all the 
desires of the bride. Speaks of the suspension of the faculties and 
tells how some souls reach this sublime prayer in a short time. </p><p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe King brought me into the wine cellar and 
set charity in order within me. (Sg. 2:4) </i></p>
<p>
  1. WELL, NOW THAT THE SOUL is resting under the 
longed-for shadow, and rightly so, what is left for it to 
desire unless that it never lack this good? It doesn't think there 
is anything more to desire. But our most sacred King has still 
much to give. He would never want to do anything else than 
give if He could find receivers. And as I have said often — I want you never to forget, daughters — the Lord is never content 
with giving us as little as we desire; I have seen it here. He 
grants the soul in answer to some of its petitions an opportunity 
to merit and suffer something for Him, whereas the soul's intention was to suffer only what its strength could bear. Since 
His Majesty can make one's strength increase in payment for 
the little that one determines to do for Him, He will give so 
many trials and persecutions and illnesses that a poor man 
won't know himself. 

      </p>
      <p>
2. This happened to me when I was quite young. Sometimes 
I would say, "Oh, Lord, I didn't want so much." But His Majesty gave strength and patience in such a way that even now I 
am amazed at how I was able to suffer, and I would not exchange those trials for all the world's treasures. 

      </p>
      <p>
       The bride says:<i> The King brought me. </i> How appropriate this 
name, "powerful King," is, for the Lord has no superior, nor 
will His reign ever end. Surely the soul in such a state will 
understand much about the greatness of this King; but not 
everything since that is impossible in this mortal life. 
      </p>
      <p>
       3.  She says: <i>He brought me into the wine cellar; set charity 
in order within me.</i> I understand from these words the 
grandeur of this favor. For a greater or less amount can be 
given a person to drink, a good or a better wine, and the wine 
will leave him more or less inebriated and intoxicated. So with 
the favors of the Lord; to one He gives a little wine of devotion, 
to another more, with another He increases it in such a way 
that the person begins to go out from himself, from his sensuality, and from all earthly things; to some He gives great fervor in His service; to others, impulses of love; to others, great 
charity toward their neighbors. These gifts are given in such a 
way that these persons go about so stupefied they do not feel 
the great trials that take place here. But much is contained in 
what the bride says. He brings her into the wine cellar so that 
she may come out more abundantly enriched. It doesn't seem 
the King wants to keep anything from her. He wants her to 
drink in conformity with her desire and become wholly inebriated, drinking of all the wines in God's storehouse. Let the 
soul rejoice in these joys. Let it admire God's grandeurs. 
      </p>
      <p>Let it not fear to lose its life from drinking so much beyond 
what its natural weakness can endure. Let it die in this 
paradise of delights. Blessed be such a death that so makes 
one live! And truly this is what it makes the soul do. For the 
marvels the soul understands are so great — without its 
understanding how it understands — that it remains outside 
itself. The bride refers to this in saying:<i> He set charity in order 
within me. </i>
</p><p>
4. Oh, words that should never be forgotten by the soul to 
whom the Lord gives delight! Oh, sovereign favor! How im- 
possible it is to deserve if the Lord does not give the wealth re- 
quired for it. Indeed the soul does not even find itself awake in 
order to love. But blessed sleep, happy inebriation that makes 
the Bridegroom supply for what the soul cannot do; that is, set 
up so wonderful an order. For while the faculties are dead or 
asleep, love remains alive. And the Lord ordains that the soul 
function so wonderfully, without its understanding how, that it 
is made one, in great purity, with the very Lord of love, who is 
God. For no one hinders the soul, neither senses nor faculties (I 
mean intellect and memory), nor is the will aware of itself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        5. I was wondering now whether there is some difference 
between the will and love. And it seems to me there is. I don't 
know whether or not I'm speaking foolishly. But it seems to me 
that love is like an arrow sent forth by the will. If it travels with 
all the force that the will has, freed from all earthly things, and 
directed to God alone, it truly must wound His Majesty. Thus, 
fixed in God Himself, who is love, it is brought back from there 
with the greatest gain, as I shall say. I have been informed by 
some persons whom our Lord has brought to this great favor in 
prayer that He brings them to this holy inebriation with a 
suspension and that even exteriorly one can see they are not in 
themselves. When I ask what they feel, they are completely 
unable to explain; nor could they know how to do so, nor 
would they be able to understand anything of how love works 
there. 
      </p>
      <p>
6. The tremendous gain drawn from this kind of prayer is 
clearly recognized through the effects, the virtues, the living 
faith and the contempt for the world left in the soul. But since these blessings and what the soul enjoys here are gifts, nothing 
is understood — except at the beginning — for the sweetness is 
very great. Thus what the bride says is clear: that is, the 
wisdom of God supplies here for the soul, and He ordains the 
way in which it gains these marvelous favors during that time. 
Since it is so outside itself and so absorbed that it can do 
nothing with the faculties, how can it merit? Well, is it possible 
for God to grant it a favor so great that it wastes time and gains 
nothing in Him? No, I don't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
7. Oh, secrets of God! Here there is no more to do than surrender our intellects and reflect that they are of no avail when 
it comes to understanding the grandeurs of God. It is good to 
recall here how God acted with the Blessed Virgin, our Lady. 
In spite of all her wisdom she asked the angel: <i>How can this be? 
But after he answered, The Holy Spirit will come upon you; 
the power of the Most High will overshadow you,</i> she engaged 
in no further discussion. As one who had such great faith and 
wisdom, she understood at once that if these two intervened, 
there was nothing more to know or doubt. She did not act as do 
some learned men (whom the Lord does not lead by this mode 
of prayer and who haven't begun a life of prayer), for they 
want to be so rational about things and so precise in their 
understanding that it doesn't seem anyone else but they with 
their learning can understand the grandeurs of God. If only 
they would learn something from the humility of the most 
Blessed Virgin!
      </p>
      <p>
8. O Blessed Lady, how perfectly we can apply to you what 
takes place between God and the bride according to what is 
said in the <i>Song of Songs.</i> And thus you can see, daughters, in 
the Office of our Lady, which we recite each week, how much 
in its antiphons and readings is taken from this <i>Song of Songs. </i>
As for other souls, each one can understand according to the 
understanding God wants to give him, for he will see very clear- 
ly if he is receiving some of these favors, similar to what the 
bride says: <i>He set charity in order within me. </i> For souls that 
receive this favor do not know where they were, or how through 
a delight so sublime they could have pleased the Lord, or what 
they were doing since they did not give Him thanks for it. 
      </p>
      <p>
9. O soul, beloved of God! Do not be anxious when His Majesty brings you here and speaks so endearingly; as you will see 
in many words that He says to the bride in the <i>Song of Songs,</i> 
such as: <i>You are all beautiful, my love,</i> and many others, as I 
say. By these He shows He is happy with her. Thus you should 
believe that He will not consent to your being displeasing to 
Him at that time, but He will help you in what you might not 
have known so that He may be more pleased with you. He sees 
the soul lost to itself, transported so as to love Him, and that 
love's very force has taken away the intellect in order that the 
soul may love more. Indeed, His Majesty is not wont to fail nor 
can He fail to give Himself to the one who has given Him 
everything, nor could He endure not doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
10. It seems to me His Majesty is embellishing with His gifts 
this gold He has prepared and tested so as to see how many 
carats the soul's love is. These gifts are bestowed in a thousand 
ways and modes of which only the soul having arrived here will 
be able to speak. This soul, which is the gold, no more moves 
or works during this time than if it were in fact gold. And 
divine Wisdom, happy to see it thus (since there are so few who 
love Him with this strength) makes a thousand designs in the 
gold with inlays of precious stones and enamels.
      </p>
      <p>
11. Well now, this soul, what does it do at this time? This is 
what cannot be understood or known beyond what the bride 
says: <i>He set charity in order within me.</i> The soul, at least if it 
loves, does not know how nor does it understand what it loves. 
The King's most intense love, which has brought the soul to 
this high state, must have joined this soul's love to itself in such 
a way that the intellect does not deserve to understand; but 
these two loves become one again. Since the soul's love is 
brought so truly close to the love of God, how can the intellect 
reach that far? The intellect loses sight at that time, for the 
union never lasts long, but is brief. And there God sets love in 
order in such a way that it then knows well how to please His 
Majesty and even afterward, without understanding on the 
part of the intellect, as was said. But the intellect understands 
well afterward when it sees this soul with the enamel and inlays 
of precious stones and pearls of virtue, for it is amazed and can say: <i>Who is this that is as bright as the sun?</i>
      </p>
      <p>
O true King, and how right the bride was in giving You this 
name! For in a moment You can give riches and place them in 
a soul that they may be enjoyed forever. How well ordered love 
is in this soul! 
      </p>
      <p>
12. I shall be able to give good examples of this because I 
have met some persons in this stage of prayer. I now remember 
one of them. Within three days the Lord gave her such blessings that were it not for my experience with her for some years 
and my seeing her always improve, I would not have believed 
the blessings possible. And I saw Him do the same for another 
within three months; and both were quite young. Others I have 
seen to whom God grants this favor after a long time. I have 
mentioned these two — and I could mention some 
others — because I have written here that few are those to 
whom our Lord grants these favors without their having 
undergone many years of trials, and thus it may be understood 
that there are some exceptions. One must not place limits on a 
Lord so great and desirous to grant favors. I am speaking of 
true favors from God, not of illusions or of the results of melancholy or of our own natural efforts. Only time will tell where 
the favors come from. When they are from God the virtues 
grow so strong and love becomes so enkindled that there's no 
concealing the two. Even without any specific desire on the 
part of the soul, they always bring profit to other souls.
      </p>
      <p>
13. <i>The King set charity in order within me,</i> set it in order 
so well that the love the soul had for the world is taken away; 
the soul's love of itself turns to disregard; its love for its relatives 
is such that it loves them solely for God; its love for its 
neighbors and its enemies is unbelievable unless experienced—a very strong love; its love of God is boundless, for 
sometimes the love impels it so much that its lowly nature cannot endure the love. And since the soul sees that it is now growing weak and about to die, it says: <i>Sustain me with flowers; surround me with apples for I am dying with the sickness of love.</i>
      </p>
               <section id="7">

  <h5>  CHAPTER 7</h5>
      <p>
       <i> Explains the bride's strong desires to suffer much for God and 
neighbor and the abundant fruits that come to the Church 
from souls favored by the divine union and detached from self- 
interest. </p><p>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSustain me with flowers and surround me 
with apples, for I am dying of love. (Sg. 2:5) </p></i><p>
 1. OH, HOW WELL this divine language applies to what I 
want to speak of here! Holy bride, how is it that this 
sweetness slays you! From what I have known, sometimes the 
delight is so excessive that it seems to dissolve the soul in such a 
way that there is no longer any desire to live. And do you ask 
for flowers? What flowers will these be? Flowers will provide no 
remedy unless you ask for them so as to die, for in truth 
nothing else is desired when the soul arrives here. But this interpretation doesn't fit well because the bride says: <i>sustain me 
with flowers.</i> Asking to be sustained doesn't seem to me to involve a request for death but for life and the desire to serve in 
some way the One to whom she sees she owes so much. 
      </p>
      <p>
  2. Don't think, daughters, there is any exaggeration in saying that she dies. As I have said, it indeed happens that love 
sometimes operates with such force that it rules over all the 
powers of the natural subject. Thus, I know a person who while 
in this kind of prayer heard someone, with a beautiful voice, 
singing; and she certifies that, in her opinion, if the singing 
had not stopped the soul would have gone out of itself on account of the great delight and sweetness the Lord gave it to enjoy. His Majesty provided that the singing stop, for the one who 
was in this suspension could easily have died. But because she 
was powerless to stir or make any exterior movement, she 
couldn't tell the one singing to stop. And she was clearly aware 
of the danger she was in, but her state resembled that of someone in a deep sleep who is unable to come out of it and speak 
even though he may want to.
      </p>
      <p>
  3. In this suspension the soul would not want to come out of 
this sleep, nor would death be painful to it but great happiness, for this is what it desires. And how happy a death it 
would be, at the hands of this love! But sometimes His Majesty 
gives it light to see that living is good for it. However, the soul 
sees that its natural weakness will not be able to suffer that 
good for long if the delight lasts, and begs Him for another 
good so as to escape from that one that is so extraordinary, and 
thus it says: <i>sustain me with flowers. </i>
      </p>
      <p>
The fragrance of these flowers is different from the 
fragrance of flowers we smell here below. I understand by these 
words that the soul is asking to perform great works in the service of our Lord and of its neighbor. For this purpose it is happy 
to lose that delight and satisfaction. Although a person's life 
will become more active than contemplative, and one will 
seemingly lose if the petition is granted, Martha and Mary 
never fail to work almost together when the soul is in this state. 
For in the active — and seemingly exterior — work the soul is 
working interiorly. And when the active works rise from this interior root, they become lovely and very fragrant flowers. For 
they proceed from this tree of God's love and are done for Him 
alone, without any self-interest. The fragrance from these 
flowers spreads to the benefit of many. It is a fragrance that 
lasts, not passing quickly, but having great effect. 
      </p>
      <p>
4. I want to explain myself further so that you understand. 
Someone preaches a sermon with the intention of benefitting 
souls, but he is not so detached from human considerations 
that he doesn't make some attempt to please, or to gain honor 
or credit; or he has his mind set on receiving some canonry for 
having preached well. There are also other things people do for 
their neighbor's benefit — many things — and with a good intention, but with much care not to lose anything through them 
and not to displease. They fear persecution; they want to be 
pleasing to kings, lords, and the people; they proceed with the 
discretion the world so much honors. This discretion is a 
shelter for many imperfections; they call it "discretion," and 
please God it will be.
      </p>
      <p>
5. These persons will serve His Majesty, and they profit much. But, in my opinion, such are not the works and flowers 
asked for by the bride; she looks only for the honor and glory of 
God in everything. Truly, I don't believe that souls brought to 
this state by the Lord, from what I have understood of some, 
think of themselves, and of whether they will lose or gain, any 
more than if they did not exist. They look only at serving and 
pleasing the Lord. And because they know the love He has for 
His servants, they like to leave aside their own satisfaction and 
good so as to please Him and serve and tell souls beneficial 
truths by the best means they can. Nor do they, as I say, think 
about whether or not they will themselves lose. They keep 
before their minds the benefit of their neighbor, nothing else. 
So as to please God more, they forget themselves for their 
neighbor's sake, and they lose their lives in the challenge, as 
did many martyrs. They are not aware of the words they say 
while enveloped in so sublime a love of God, in their inebriation from that heavenly wine. And if they are aware, they don't 
care if they displease men. These souls do much good. 
      </p>
      <p>
6. I recall now what I have often thought concerning that 
holy Samaritan woman, for she must have been wounded by 
this herb. How well she must have taken into her heart the 
words of the Lord, since she left the Lord for the gain and 
profit of the people of her village. This explains well what I am 
saying. And in payment for her great charity, she merited to be 
believed and to see the wonderful good our Lord did in that 
village.
      </p>
      <p>
      It seems to me that one of the greatest consolations a person 
can have on earth must be to see other souls helped through his 
own efforts. Then, it seems to me, one eats the delicious fruit 
of these flowers. Happy are those to whom the Lord grants 
these favors. These souls are indeed obligated to serve Him. 
This holy woman, in that divine intoxication, went shouting 
through the streets. What amazes me is to see how the people 
believed her — a woman. And she must not have been well-off 
since she went to draw water. Indeed she was very humble 
because when the Lord told her faults to her she didn't become 
offended (as the world does now, for the truth is hard to bear), 
but she told Him that He must be a prophet. In sum, the people believed her; and a large crowd, on her word alone, went 
out of the city to meet the Lord. 
   </p>
      <p>
7. So I say that much good is done by those who, after 
speaking with His Majesty for several years, when receiving His 
gifts and delights, want to serve in laborious ways even though 
these delights and consolations are thereby hindered. I say that 
the fragrance of these flowers and works produced and flowing 
from the tree of such fervent love lasts much longer. One of 
these souls does more good with its words and works than do 
many others whose works carry the dust of our sensuality and 
some self-interest. 
      </p>
      <p>
8. From these flowers comes the fruit, the apples of which 
the bride then says:<i> Surround me with apples.</i> Give me trials, 
Lord; give me persecutions. And truly this soul desires them 
and indeed passes through them well. For since it no longer 
looks to its own satisfaction but to what pleases God, its 
pleasure is in somehow imitating the laborious life that Christ 
lived. 
      </p>
      <p>
By the "apple tree," I understand the tree of the cross 
because it is said in another verse in the <i>Song of Songs: under 
the apple tree I raised you up.</i> And a soul that is surrounded 
by crosses, trials, and persecutions has a powerful remedy 
against often continuing in the delight of contemplation. It 
finds great delight in suffering; but suffering doesn't consume 
it and waste its strength, as would this suspension, if very frequent, of the faculties in contemplation. And the soul also has 
another reason for making this request, for it must not be 
always enjoying without serving and working in something. I 
notice in some persons — there are not many because of our 
sins — that the more they advance in this kind of prayer and the 
gifts of our Lord the more attention they pay to the needs of 
their neighbor, especially to the needs of their neighbors' souls. 
For to draw one soul away from mortal sin it seems such persons would give many lives, as I said at the beginning. 
      </p>
      <p>
      9. Who will make those to whom our Lord begins to give 
these delights believe this? But perhaps it will seem to them 
that such persons are not making good use of their lives and 
that to remain in a corner enjoying this delight is what is important. It belongs to the Lord's providence, in my opinion, 
that these beginners do not understand where these other souls 
are because with this initial fervor they would immediately 
want to leap forward to that stage. But such a quick move 
ahead does not suit them, for they are still not weaned. It's 
necessary that they be nourished some days more with the milk 
I mentioned at the beginning. Let them remain close to those 
divine breasts, for the Lord will take care, when they are 
strong, to bring them further. Otherwise, they would not do 
the good they think; rather they would harm themselves. Since 
in the book I mentioned 6 you will find very detailed explanations about when a soul may go out to benefit others and about 
the danger that lies in going out ahead of time, I do not want 
to mention the matter here or enlarge upon this any more. 
When I began, my intention was simply to explain how you can 
find comfort when you hear some words from the <i>Song of 
Songs,</i> and how, even though they are obscure to your 
understanding, you can reflect upon the profound mysteries 
contained in them. It would be bold of me to go on at any 
greater length. 
      </p>
      <p>
10. May it please the Lord that what I have said may not 
have been bold. The work has been done to obey the one who 
commanded me to do it. May His Majesty be served in 
everything. If something good is here, you can indeed believe 
that it does not come from me; the Sisters here with me have 
seen that because of my many occupations I have written this 
hastily. Beseech His Majesty that I may understand through 
experience what has been said. Any Sister who thinks she has 
some experience of these delights should praise our Lord and 
ask Him for the latter-mentioned works and trials so that the 
gain will not be just for herself. 
      </p>
      <p>
   May it please our Lord to keep us in His hands and teach us 
always how to carry out His will, amen.
